---

## [​](#use-specialized-subagents) Use specialized subagents

Suppose you want to use specialized AI subagents to handle specific tasks more effectively.

1

View available subagents

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> /agents
```

This shows all available subagents and lets you create new ones.

2

Use subagents automatically

Claude Code automatically delegates appropriate tasks to specialized subagents:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> review my recent code changes for security issues
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> run all tests and fix any failures
```

3

Explicitly request specific subagents

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> use the code-reviewer subagent to check the auth module
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> have the debugger subagent investigate why users can't log in
```

4

Create custom subagents for your workflow

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> /agents
```

Then select “Create New subagent” and follow the prompts to define:

* A unique identifier that describes the subagent’s purpose (for example, `code-reviewer`, `api-designer`).
* When Claude should use this agent
* Which tools it can access
* A system prompt describing the agent’s role and behavior

Tips:

* Create project-specific subagents in `.claude/agents/` for team sharing
* Use descriptive `description` fields to enable automatic delegation
* Limit tool access to what each subagent actually needs
* Check the [subagents documentation](/docs/en/sub-agents) for detailed examples

---

## [​](#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis) Use Plan Mode for safe code analysis

Plan Mode instructs Claude to create a plan by analyzing the codebase with read-only operations, perfect for exploring codebases, planning complex changes, or reviewing code safely. In Plan Mode, Claude uses [`AskUserQuestion`](/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) to gather requirements and clarify your goals before proposing a plan.

### [​](#when-to-use-plan-mode) When to use Plan Mode

* **Multi-step implementation**: When your feature requires making edits to many files
* **Code exploration**: When you want to research the codebase thoroughly before changing anything
* **Interactive development**: When you want to iterate on the direction with Claude

### [​](#how-to-use-plan-mode) How to use Plan Mode

**Turn on Plan Mode during a session**
You can switch into Plan Mode during a session using **Shift+Tab** to cycle through permission modes.
If you are in Normal Mode, **Shift+Tab** first switches into Auto-Accept Mode, indicated by `⏵⏵ accept edits on` at the bottom of the terminal. A subsequent **Shift+Tab** will switch into Plan Mode, indicated by `⏸ plan mode on`.
**Start a new session in Plan Mode**
To start a new session in Plan Mode, use the `--permission-mode plan` flag:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --permission-mode plan
```

**Run “headless” queries in Plan Mode**
You can also run a query in Plan Mode directly with `-p` (that is, in [“headless mode”](/docs/en/headless)):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --permission-mode plan -p "Analyze the authentication system and suggest improvements"
```

### [​](#example-planning-a-complex-refactor) Example: Planning a complex refactor

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --permission-mode plan
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> I need to refactor our authentication system to use OAuth2. Create a detailed migration plan.
```

Claude analyzes the current implementation and create a comprehensive plan. Refine with follow-ups:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> What about backward compatibility?
> How should we handle database migration?
```

Press `Ctrl+G` to open the plan in your default text editor, where you can edit it directly before Claude proceeds.

### [​](#configure-plan-mode-as-default) Configure Plan Mode as default

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "plan"
  }
}
```

See [settings documentation](/docs/en/settings#available-settings) for more configuration options.


---

## [​](#work-with-tests) Work with tests

Suppose you need to add tests for uncovered code.

1

Identify untested code

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> find functions in NotificationsService.swift that are not covered by tests
```

2

Generate test scaffolding

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> add tests for the notification service
```

3

Add meaningful test cases

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> add test cases for edge conditions in the notification service
```

4

Run and verify tests

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> run the new tests and fix any failures
```

Claude can generate tests that follow your project’s existing patterns and conventions. When asking for tests, be specific about what behavior you want to verify. Claude examines your existing test files to match the style, frameworks, and assertion patterns already in use.
For comprehensive coverage, ask Claude to identify edge cases you might have missed. Claude can analyze your code paths and suggest tests for error conditions, boundary values, and unexpected inputs that are easy to overlook.


---

## [​](#create-pull-requests) Create pull requests

You can create pull requests by asking Claude directly (“create a pr for my changes”) or by using the `/commit-push-pr` skill, which commits, pushes, and opens a PR in one step.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> /commit-push-pr
```

If you have a Slack MCP server configured and specify channels in your CLAUDE.md (for example, “post PR URLs to #team-prs”), the skill automatically posts the PR URL to those channels.
For more control over the process, guide Claude through it step-by-step or [create your own skill](/docs/en/skills):

1

Summarize your changes

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> summarize the changes I've made to the authentication module
```

2

Generate a pull request

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> create a pr
```

3

Review and refine

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> enhance the PR description with more context about the security improvements
```

When you create a PR using `gh pr create`, the session is automatically linked to that PR. You can resume it later with `claude --from-pr <number>`.

Review Claude’s generated PR before submitting and ask Claude to highlight potential risks or considerations.

## [​](#handle-documentation) Handle documentation

Suppose you need to add or update documentation for your code.

1

Identify undocumented code

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> find functions without proper JSDoc comments in the auth module
```

2

Generate documentation

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> add JSDoc comments to the undocumented functions in auth.js
```

3

Review and enhance

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> improve the generated documentation with more context and examples
```

4

Verify documentation

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> check if the documentation follows our project standards
```

Tips:

* Specify the documentation style you want (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
* Ask for examples in the documentation
* Request documentation for public APIs, interfaces, and complex logic

---

## [​](#work-with-images) Work with images

Suppose you need to work with images in your codebase, and you want Claude’s help analyzing image content.

1

Add an image to the conversation

You can use any of these methods:

1. Drag and drop an image into the Claude Code window
2. Copy an image and paste it into the CLI with ctrl+v (Do not use cmd+v)
3. Provide an image path to Claude. E.g., “Analyze this image: /path/to/your/image.png”

2

Ask Claude to analyze the image

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> What does this image show?
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
```

3

Use images for context

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> This is our current database schema. How should we modify it for the new feature?
```

4

Get code suggestions from visual content

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> Generate CSS to match this design mockup
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> What HTML structure would recreate this component?
```

Tips:

* Use images when text descriptions would be unclear or cumbersome
* Include screenshots of errors, UI designs, or diagrams for better context
* You can work with multiple images in a conversation
* Image analysis works with diagrams, screenshots, mockups, and more
* When Claude references images (for example, `[Image #1]`), `Cmd+Click` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Click` (Windows/Linux) the link to open the image in your default viewer

---

## [​](#reference-files-and-directories) Reference files and directories

Use @ to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Claude to read them.

1

Reference a single file

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
```

This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.

2

Reference a directory

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> What's the structure of @src/components?
```

This provides a directory listing with file information.

3

Reference MCP resources

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
```

This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format @server:resource. See [MCP resources](/docs/en/mcp#use-mcp-resources) for details.

Tips:

* File paths can be relative or absolute
* @ file references add `CLAUDE.md` in the file’s directory and parent directories to context
* Directory references show file listings, not contents
* You can reference multiple files in a single message (for example, “@file1.js and @file2.js”)

---

## [​](#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) Use extended thinking (thinking mode)

[Extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) is enabled by default, giving Claude space to reason through complex problems step-by-step before responding. This reasoning is visible in verbose mode, which you can toggle on with `Ctrl+O`.
Additionally, Opus 4.6 introduces adaptive reasoning: instead of a fixed thinking token budget, the model dynamically allocates thinking based on your [effort level](/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) setting. Extended thinking and adaptive reasoning work together to give you control over how deeply Claude reasons before responding.
Extended thinking is particularly valuable for complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, multi-step implementation planning, and evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches.

Phrases like “think”, “think hard”, “ultrathink”, and “think more” are interpreted as regular prompt instructions and don’t allocate thinking tokens.

### [​](#configure-thinking-mode) Configure thinking mode

Thinking is enabled by default, but you can adjust or disable it.

| Scope | How to configure | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Effort level** | Adjust in `/model` or set [`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) | Control thinking depth for Opus 4.6: low, medium, high (default). See [Adjust effort level](/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) |
| **Toggle shortcut** | Press `Option+T` (macOS) or `Alt+T` (Windows/Linux) | Toggle thinking on/off for the current session (all models). May require [terminal configuration](/docs/en/terminal-config) to enable Option key shortcuts |
| **Global default** | Use `/config` to toggle thinking mode | Sets your default across all projects (all models). Saved as `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| **Limit token budget** | Set [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) environment variable | Limit the thinking budget to a specific number of tokens (ignored on Opus 4.6 unless set to 0). Example: `export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000` |

To view Claude’s thinking process, press `Ctrl+O` to toggle verbose mode and see the internal reasoning displayed as gray italic text.

### [​](#how-extended-thinking-works) How extended thinking works

Extended thinking controls how much internal reasoning Claude performs before responding. More thinking provides more space to explore solutions, analyze edge cases, and self-correct mistakes.
**With Opus 4.6**, thinking uses adaptive reasoning: the model dynamically allocates thinking tokens based on the [effort level](/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) you select (low, medium, high). This is the recommended way to tune the tradeoff between speed and reasoning depth.
**With other models**, thinking uses a fixed budget of up to 31,999 tokens from your output budget. You can limit this with the [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) environment variable, or disable thinking entirely via `/config` or the `Option+T`/`Alt+T` toggle.
`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` is ignored when using Opus 4.6, since adaptive reasoning controls thinking depth instead. The one exception: setting `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` still disables thinking entirely on any model.

You’re charged for all thinking tokens used, even though Claude 4 models show summarized thinking

---

## [​](#resume-previous-conversations) Resume previous conversations

When starting Claude Code, you can resume a previous session:

* `claude --continue` continues the most recent conversation in the current directory
* `claude --resume` opens a conversation picker or resumes by name
* `claude --from-pr 123` resumes sessions linked to a specific pull request

From inside an active session, use `/resume` to switch to a different conversation.
Sessions are stored per project directory. The `/resume` picker shows sessions from the same git repository, including worktrees.

### [​](#name-your-sessions) Name your sessions

Give sessions descriptive names to find them later. This is a best practice when working on multiple tasks or features.

1

Name the current session

Use `/rename` during a session to give it a memorable name:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> /rename auth-refactor
```

You can also rename any session from the picker: run `/resume`, navigate to a session, and press `R`.

2

Resume by name later

From the command line:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --resume auth-refactor
```

Or from inside an active session:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
> /resume auth-refactor
```

### [​](#use-the-session-picker) Use the session picker

The `/resume` command (or `claude --resume` without arguments) opens an interactive session picker with these features:
**Keyboard shortcuts in the picker:**

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate between sessions |
| `→` / `←` | Expand or collapse grouped sessions |
| `Enter` | Select and resume the highlighted session |
| `P` | Preview the session content |
| `R` | Rename the highlighted session |
| `/` | Search to filter sessions |
| `A` | Toggle between current directory and all projects |
| `B` | Filter to sessions from your current git branch |
| `Esc` | Exit the picker or search mode |

**Session organization:**
The picker displays sessions with helpful metadata:

* Session name or initial prompt
* Time elapsed since last activity
* Message count
* Git branch (if applicable)

Forked sessions (created with `/rewind` or `--fork-session`) are grouped together under their root session, making it easier to find related conversations.

Tips:

* **Name sessions early**: Use `/rename` when starting work on a distinct task—it’s much easier to find “payment-integration” than “explain this function” later
* Use `--continue` for quick access to your most recent conversation in the current directory
* Use `--resume session-name` when you know which session you need
* Use `--resume` (without a name) when you need to browse and select
* For scripts, use `claude --continue --print "prompt"` to resume in non-interactive mode
* Press `P` in the picker to preview a session before resuming it
* The resumed conversation starts with the same model and configuration as the original

How it works:

1. **Conversation Storage**: All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history
2. **Message Deserialization**: When resuming, the entire message history is restored to maintain context
3. **Tool State**: Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved
4. **Context Restoration**: The conversation resumes with all previous context intact

## [​](#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees) Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees

Suppose you need to work on multiple tasks simultaneously with complete code isolation between Claude Code instances.

1

Understand Git worktrees

Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same
repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working
directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history. Learn
more in the [official Git worktree
documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).

2

Create a new worktree

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Create a new worktree with a new branch 
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

# Or create a worktree with an existing branch
git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
```

This creates a new directory with a separate working copy of your repository.

3

Run Claude Code in each worktree

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Navigate to your worktree 
cd ../project-feature-a

# Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
claude
```

4

Run Claude in another worktree

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
cd ../project-bugfix
claude
```

5

Manage your worktrees

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
```

Tips:

* Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
* Changes made in one worktree won’t affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other
* All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
* For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another
* Use descriptive directory names to easily identify which task each worktree is for
* Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project’s setup. Depending on your stack, this might include:
  + JavaScript projects: Running dependency installation (`npm install`, `yarn`)
  + Python projects: Setting up virtual environments or installing with package managers
  + Other languages: Following your project’s standard setup process

For automated coordination of parallel sessions with shared tasks and messaging, see [agent teams](/docs/en/agent-teams).

## [​](#use-claude-as-a-unix-style-utility) Use Claude as a unix-style utility

### [​](#add-claude-to-your-verification-process) Add Claude to your verification process

Suppose you want to use Claude Code as a linter or code reviewer.
**Add Claude to your build script:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
// package.json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
```

Tips:

* Use Claude for automated code review in your CI/CD pipeline
* Customize the prompt to check for specific issues relevant to your project
* Consider creating multiple scripts for different types of verification

### [​](#pipe-in-pipe-out) Pipe in, pipe out

Suppose you want to pipe data into Claude, and get back data in a structured format.
**Pipe data through Claude:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

Tips:

* Use pipes to integrate Claude into existing shell scripts
* Combine with other Unix tools for powerful workflows
* Consider using —output-format for structured output

### [​](#control-output-format) Control output format

Suppose you need Claude’s output in a specific format, especially when integrating Claude Code into scripts or other tools.

1

Use text format (default)

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt
```

This outputs just Claude’s plain text response (default behavior).

2

Use JSON format

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json
```

This outputs a JSON array of messages with metadata including cost and duration.

3

Use streaming JSON format

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
```

This outputs a series of JSON objects in real-time as Claude processes the request. Each message is a valid JSON object, but the entire output is not valid JSON if concatenated.

Tips:

* Use `--output-format text` for simple integrations where you just need Claude’s response
* Use `--output-format json` when you need the full conversation log
* Use `--output-format stream-json` for real-time output of each conversation turn
