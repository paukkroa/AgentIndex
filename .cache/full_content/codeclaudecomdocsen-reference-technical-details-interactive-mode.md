## [​](#keyboard-shortcuts) Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts may vary by platform and terminal. Press `?` to see available shortcuts for your environment.**macOS users**: Option/Alt key shortcuts (`Alt+B`, `Alt+F`, `Alt+Y`, `Alt+M`, `Alt+P`) require configuring Option as Meta in your terminal:

* **iTerm2**: Settings → Profiles → Keys → Set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+”
* **Terminal.app**: Settings → Profiles → Keyboard → Check “Use Option as Meta Key”
* **VS Code**: Settings → Profiles → Keys → Set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+”

See [Terminal configuration](/docs/en/terminal-config) for details.

### [​](#mcp-prompts) MCP prompts

MCP servers can expose prompts that appear as commands. These use the format `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` and are dynamically discovered from connected servers. See [MCP prompts](/docs/en/mcp#use-mcp-prompts-as-commands) for details.

## [​](#vim-editor-mode) Vim editor mode

Enable vim-style editing with `/vim` command or configure permanently via `/config`.

| `Esc` | Enter NORMAL mode | INSERT |
| `i` | Insert before cursor | NORMAL |
| `I` | Insert at beginning of line | NORMAL |
| `a` | Insert after cursor | NORMAL |
| `A` | Insert at end of line | NORMAL |
| `o` | Open line below | NORMAL |
| `O` | Open line above | NORMAL |

### [​](#navigation-normal-mode) Navigation (NORMAL mode)

| `i(`/`a(` | Inner/around parentheses |
| `i[`/`a[` | Inner/around brackets |
| `i{`/`a{` | Inner/around braces |

## [​](#command-history) Command history

Claude Code maintains command history for the current session:

* History is stored per working directory
* Cleared with `/clear` command
* Use Up/Down arrows to navigate (see keyboard shortcuts above)
* **Note**: History expansion (`!`) is disabled by default

### [​](#reverse-search-with-ctrl+r) Reverse search with Ctrl+R

Press `Ctrl+R` to interactively search through your command history:

1. **Start search**: Press `Ctrl+R` to activate reverse history search
2. **Type query**: Enter text to search for in previous commands - the search term will be highlighted in matching results
3. **Navigate matches**: Press `Ctrl+R` again to cycle through older matches
4. **Accept match**:
   * Press `Tab` or `Esc` to accept the current match and continue editing
   * Press `Enter` to accept and execute the command immediately
5. **Cancel search**:
   * Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and restore your original input
   * Press `Backspace` on empty search to cancel

The search displays matching commands with the search term highlighted, making it easy to find and reuse previous inputs.

## [​](#background-bash-commands) Background bash commands

Claude Code supports running bash commands in the background, allowing you to continue working while long-running processes execute.

### [​](#how-backgrounding-works) How backgrounding works

When Claude Code runs a command in the background, it runs the command asynchronously and immediately returns a background task ID. Claude Code can respond to new prompts while the command continues executing in the background.
To run commands in the background, you can either:

* Prompt Claude Code to run a command in the background
* Press Ctrl+B to move a regular Bash tool invocation to the background. (Tmux users must press Ctrl+B twice due to tmux’s prefix key.)

**Key features:**

* Output is buffered and Claude can retrieve it using the TaskOutput tool
* Background tasks have unique IDs for tracking and output retrieval
* Background tasks are automatically cleaned up when Claude Code exits

To disable all background task functionality, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS` environment variable to `1`. See [Environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) for details.
**Common backgrounded commands:**

* Build tools (webpack, vite, make)
* Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
* Test runners (jest, pytest)
* Development servers
* Long-running processes (docker, terraform)

### [​](#bash-mode-with-prefix) Bash mode with `!` prefix

Run bash commands directly without going through Claude by prefixing your input with `!`:

Ask AI

```
! npm test
! git status
! ls -la
```

Bash mode:

* Adds the command and its output to the conversation context
* Shows real-time progress and output
* Supports the same `Ctrl+B` backgrounding for long-running commands
* Does not require Claude to interpret or approve the command
* Supports history-based autocomplete: type a partial command and press **Tab** to complete from previous `!` commands in the current project

This is useful for quick shell operations while maintaining conversation context.

## [​](#prompt-suggestions) Prompt suggestions

When you first open a session, a grayed-out example command appears in the prompt input to help you get started. Claude Code picks this from your project’s git history, so it reflects files you’ve been working on recently.
After Claude responds, suggestions continue to appear based on your conversation history, such as a follow-up step from a multi-part request or a natural continuation of your workflow.

* Press **Tab** to accept the suggestion, or press **Enter** to accept and submit
* Start typing to dismiss it

The suggestion runs as a background request that reuses the parent conversation’s prompt cache, so the additional cost is minimal. Claude Code skips suggestion generation when the cache is cold to avoid unnecessary cost.
Suggestions are automatically skipped after the first turn of a conversation, in non-interactive mode, and in plan mode.
To disable prompt suggestions entirely, set the environment variable or toggle the setting in `/config`:

```
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false
```

## [​](#task-list) Task list

When working on complex, multi-step work, Claude creates a task list to track progress. Tasks appear in the status area of your terminal with indicators showing what’s pending, in progress, or complete.

* Press `Ctrl+T` to toggle the task list view. The display shows up to 10 tasks at a time
* To see all tasks or clear them, ask Claude directly: “show me all tasks” or “clear all tasks”
* Tasks persist across context compactions, helping Claude stay organized on larger projects
* To share a task list across sessions, set `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` to use a named directory in `~/.claude/tasks/`: `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=my-project claude`
* To revert to the previous TODO list, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TASKS=false`.

## [​](#pr-review-status) PR review status

When working on a branch with an open pull request, Claude Code displays a clickable PR link in the footer (for example, “PR #446”). The link has a colored underline indicating the review state:

* Green: approved
* Yellow: pending review
* Red: changes requested
* Gray: draft
* Purple: merged

`Cmd+click` (Mac) or `Ctrl+click` (Windows/Linux) the link to open the pull request in your browser. The status updates automatically every 60 seconds.

PR status requires the `gh` CLI to be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).
