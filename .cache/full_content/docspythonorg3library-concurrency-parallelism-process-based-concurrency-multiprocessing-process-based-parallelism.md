# `multiprocessing` — Process-based parallelism[¶](#module-multiprocessing "Link to this heading")

**Source code:** [Lib/multiprocessing/](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/multiprocessing/)

---

[Availability](intro.html#availability): not Android, not iOS, not WASI.

This module is not supported on [mobile platforms](intro.html#mobile-availability)
or [WebAssembly platforms](intro.html#wasm-availability).

## Introduction[¶](#introduction "Link to this heading")

`multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using an
API similar to the [`threading`](threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module. The `multiprocessing` package
offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the
[Global Interpreter Lock](../glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock) by using
subprocesses instead of threads. Due
to this, the `multiprocessing` module allows the programmer to fully
leverage multiple processors on a given machine. It runs on both POSIX and
Windows.

The `multiprocessing` module also introduces the
[`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") object which offers a convenient means of
parallelizing the execution of a function across multiple input values,
distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism). The following
example demonstrates the common practice of defining such functions in a module
so that child processes can successfully import that module. This basic example
of data parallelism using [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool"),

```
from multiprocessing import Pool

def f(x):
    return x*x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Pool(5) as p:
        print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))
```

will print to standard output

```
[1, 4, 9]
```

The `multiprocessing` module also introduces APIs which do not have
analogs in the [`threading`](threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module, like the ability to [`terminate`](#multiprocessing.Process.terminate "multiprocessing.Process.terminate"), [`interrupt`](#multiprocessing.Process.interrupt "multiprocessing.Process.interrupt") or [`kill`](#multiprocessing.Process.kill "multiprocessing.Process.kill") a running process.

See also

[`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor") offers a higher level interface
to push tasks to a background process without blocking execution of the
calling process. Compared to using the [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool")
interface directly, the [`concurrent.futures`](concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures "concurrent.futures: Execute computations concurrently using threads or processes.") API more readily allows
the submission of work to the underlying process pool to be separated from
waiting for the results.

### The [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") class[¶](#the-process-class "Link to this heading")

In `multiprocessing`, processes are spawned by creating a [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process")
object and then calling its [`start()`](#multiprocessing.Process.start "multiprocessing.Process.start") method. [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process")
follows the API of [`threading.Thread`](threading.html#threading.Thread "threading.Thread"). A trivial example of a
multiprocess program is

```
from multiprocessing import Process

def f(name):
    print('hello', name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))
    p.start()
    p.join()
```

To show the individual process IDs involved, here is an expanded example:

```
from multiprocessing import Process
import os

def info(title):
    print(title)
    print('module name:', __name__)
    print('parent process:', os.getppid())
    print('process id:', os.getpid())

def f(name):
    info('function f')
    print('hello', name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    info('main line')
    p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))
    p.start()
    p.join()
```

For an explanation of why the `if __name__ == '__main__'` part is
necessary, see [Programming guidelines](#multiprocessing-programming).

The arguments to [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") usually need to be unpickleable from within
the child process. If you tried typing the above example directly into a REPL it
could lead to an [`AttributeError`](exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") in the child process trying to locate the
*f* function in the `__main__` module.

### Contexts and start methods[¶](#contexts-and-start-methods "Link to this heading")

Depending on the platform, `multiprocessing` supports three ways
to start a process. These *start methods* are

> *spawn*
> :   The parent process starts a fresh Python interpreter process. The
>     child process will only inherit those resources necessary to run
>     the process object’s [`run()`](#multiprocessing.Process.run "multiprocessing.Process.run") method. In particular,
>     unnecessary file descriptors and handles from the parent process
>     will not be inherited. Starting a process using this method is
>     rather slow compared to using *fork* or *forkserver*.
>
>     Available on POSIX and Windows platforms. The default on Windows and macOS.
>
> *fork*
> :   The parent process uses [`os.fork()`](os.html#os.fork "os.fork") to fork the Python
>     interpreter. The child process, when it begins, is effectively
>     identical to the parent process. All resources of the parent are
>     inherited by the child process. Note that safely forking a
>     multithreaded process is problematic.
>
>     Available on POSIX systems.
>
>     Changed in version 3.14: This is no longer the default start method on any platform.
>     Code that requires *fork* must explicitly specify that via
>     [`get_context()`](#multiprocessing.get_context "multiprocessing.get_context") or [`set_start_method()`](#multiprocessing.set_start_method "multiprocessing.set_start_method").
>
>     Changed in version 3.12: If Python is able to detect that your process has multiple threads, the
>     [`os.fork()`](os.html#os.fork "os.fork") function that this start method calls internally will
>     raise a [`DeprecationWarning`](exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning"). Use a different start method.
>     See the [`os.fork()`](os.html#os.fork "os.fork") documentation for further explanation.
>
> *forkserver*
> :   When the program starts and selects the *forkserver* start method,
>     a server process is spawned. From then on, whenever a new process
>     is needed, the parent process connects to the server and requests
>     that it fork a new process. The fork server process is single threaded
>     unless system libraries or preloaded imports spawn threads as a
>     side-effect so it is generally safe for it to use [`os.fork()`](os.html#os.fork "os.fork").
>     No unnecessary resources are inherited.
>
>     Available on POSIX platforms which support passing file descriptors over
>     Unix pipes such as Linux. The default on those.
>
>     Changed in version 3.14: This became the default start method on POSIX platforms.

Changed in version 3.4: *spawn* added on all POSIX platforms, and *forkserver* added for
some POSIX platforms.
Child processes no longer inherit all of the parents inheritable
handles on Windows.

Changed in version 3.8: On macOS, the *spawn* start method is now the default. The *fork* start
method should be considered unsafe as it can lead to crashes of the
subprocess as macOS system libraries may start threads. See [bpo-33725](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33725).

Changed in version 3.14: On POSIX platforms the default start method was changed from *fork* to
*forkserver* to retain the performance but avoid common multithreaded
process incompatibilities. See [gh-84559](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84559).

On POSIX using the *spawn* or *forkserver* start methods will also
start a *resource tracker* process which tracks the unlinked named
system resources (such as named semaphores or
[`SharedMemory`](multiprocessing.shared_memory.html#multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory "multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory") objects) created
by processes of the program. When all processes
have exited the resource tracker unlinks any remaining tracked object.
Usually there should be none, but if a process was killed by a signal
there may be some “leaked” resources. (Neither leaked semaphores nor shared
memory segments will be automatically unlinked until the next reboot. This is
problematic for both objects because the system allows only a limited number of
named semaphores, and shared memory segments occupy some space in the main
memory.)

To select a start method you use the [`set_start_method()`](#multiprocessing.set_start_method "multiprocessing.set_start_method") in
the `if __name__ == '__main__'` clause of the main module. For
example:

```
import multiprocessing as mp

def foo(q):
    q.put('hello')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    mp.set_start_method('spawn')
    q = mp.Queue()
    p = mp.Process(target=foo, args=(q,))
    p.start()
    print(q.get())
    p.join()
```

[`set_start_method()`](#multiprocessing.set_start_method "multiprocessing.set_start_method") should not be used more than once in the
program.

Alternatively, you can use [`get_context()`](#multiprocessing.get_context "multiprocessing.get_context") to obtain a context
object. Context objects have the same API as the multiprocessing
module, and allow one to use multiple start methods in the same
program.

```
import multiprocessing as mp

def foo(q):
    q.put('hello')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ctx = mp.get_context('spawn')
    q = ctx.Queue()
    p = ctx.Process(target=foo, args=(q,))
    p.start()
    print(q.get())
    p.join()
```

Note that objects related to one context may not be compatible with
processes for a different context. In particular, locks created using
the *fork* context cannot be passed to processes started using the
*spawn* or *forkserver* start methods.

Libraries using `multiprocessing` or
[`ProcessPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor") should be designed to allow
their users to provide their own multiprocessing context. Using a specific
context of your own within a library can lead to incompatibilities with the
rest of the library user’s application. Always document if your library
requires a specific start method.

Warning

The `'spawn'` and `'forkserver'` start methods generally cannot
be used with “frozen” executables (i.e., binaries produced by
packages like **PyInstaller** and **cx\_Freeze**) on POSIX systems.
The `'fork'` start method may work if code does not use threads.

### Exchanging objects between processes[¶](#exchanging-objects-between-processes "Link to this heading")

`multiprocessing` supports two types of communication channel between
processes:

**Queues**

> The [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue") class is a near clone of [`queue.Queue`](queue.html#queue.Queue "queue.Queue"). For
> example:
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
>
> def f(q):
>     q.put([42, None, 'hello'])
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     q = Queue()
>     p = Process(target=f, args=(q,))
>     p.start()
>     print(q.get())    # prints "[42, None, 'hello']"
>     p.join()
> ```
>
> Queues are thread and process safe.
> Any object put into a `multiprocessing` queue will be serialized.

**Pipes**

> The [`Pipe()`](#multiprocessing.Pipe "multiprocessing.Pipe") function returns a pair of connection objects connected by a
> pipe which by default is duplex (two-way). For example:
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe
>
> def f(conn):
>     conn.send([42, None, 'hello'])
>     conn.close()
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     parent_conn, child_conn = Pipe()
>     p = Process(target=f, args=(child_conn,))
>     p.start()
>     print(parent_conn.recv())   # prints "[42, None, 'hello']"
>     p.join()
> ```
>
> The two connection objects returned by [`Pipe()`](#multiprocessing.Pipe "multiprocessing.Pipe") represent the two ends of
> the pipe. Each connection object has `send()` and
> `recv()` methods (among others). Note that data in a pipe
> may become corrupted if two processes (or threads) try to read from or write
> to the *same* end of the pipe at the same time. Of course there is no risk
> of corruption from processes using different ends of the pipe at the same
> time.
>
> The `send()` method serializes the object and
> `recv()` re-creates the object.

### Synchronization between processes[¶](#synchronization-between-processes "Link to this heading")

`multiprocessing` contains equivalents of all the synchronization
primitives from [`threading`](threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism."). For instance one can use a lock to ensure
that only one process prints to standard output at a time:

```
from multiprocessing import Process, Lock

def f(l, i):
    l.acquire()
    try:
        print('hello world', i)
    finally:
        l.release()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    lock = Lock()

    for num in range(10):
        Process(target=f, args=(lock, num)).start()
```

Without using the lock output from the different processes is liable to get all
mixed up.

### Sharing state between processes[¶](#sharing-state-between-processes "Link to this heading")

As mentioned above, when doing concurrent programming it is usually best to
avoid using shared state as far as possible. This is particularly true when
using multiple processes.

However, if you really do need to use some shared data then
`multiprocessing` provides a couple of ways of doing so.

**Shared memory**

> Data can be stored in a shared memory map using [`Value`](#multiprocessing.Value "multiprocessing.Value") or
> [`Array`](#multiprocessing.Array "multiprocessing.Array"). For example, the following code
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, Value, Array
>
> def f(n, a):
>     n.value = 3.1415927
>     for i in range(len(a)):
>         a[i] = -a[i]
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     num = Value('d', 0.0)
>     arr = Array('i', range(10))
>
>     p = Process(target=f, args=(num, arr))
>     p.start()
>     p.join()
>
>     print(num.value)
>     print(arr[:])
> ```
>
> will print
>
> ```
> 3.1415927
> [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
> ```
>
> The `'d'` and `'i'` arguments used when creating `num` and `arr` are
> typecodes of the kind used by the [`array`](array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values.") module: `'d'` indicates a
> double precision float and `'i'` indicates a signed integer. These shared
> objects will be process and thread-safe.
>
> For more flexibility in using shared memory one can use the
> [`multiprocessing.sharedctypes`](#module-multiprocessing.sharedctypes "multiprocessing.sharedctypes: Allocate ctypes objects from shared memory.") module which supports the creation of
> arbitrary ctypes objects allocated from shared memory.

**Server process**

> A manager object returned by [`Manager()`](#multiprocessing.Manager "multiprocessing.Manager") controls a server process which
> holds Python objects and allows other processes to manipulate them using
> proxies.
>
> A manager returned by [`Manager()`](#multiprocessing.Manager "multiprocessing.Manager") will support types
> [`list`](stdtypes.html#list "list"), [`dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict"), [`set`](stdtypes.html#set "set"), [`Namespace`](#multiprocessing.managers.Namespace "multiprocessing.managers.Namespace"), [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock"),
> [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock"), [`Semaphore`](#multiprocessing.Semaphore "multiprocessing.Semaphore"), [`BoundedSemaphore`](#multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore "multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore"),
> [`Condition`](#multiprocessing.Condition "multiprocessing.Condition"), [`Event`](#multiprocessing.Event "multiprocessing.Event"), [`Barrier`](#multiprocessing.Barrier "multiprocessing.Barrier"),
> [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue"), [`Value`](#multiprocessing.Value "multiprocessing.Value") and [`Array`](#multiprocessing.Array "multiprocessing.Array"). For example,
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, Manager
>
> def f(d, l, s):
>     d[1] = '1'
>     d['2'] = 2
>     d[0.25] = None
>     l.reverse()
>     s.add('a')
>     s.add('b')
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     with Manager() as manager:
>         d = manager.dict()
>         l = manager.list(range(10))
>         s = manager.set()
>
>         p = Process(target=f, args=(d, l, s))
>         p.start()
>         p.join()
>
>         print(d)
>         print(l)
>         print(s)
> ```
>
> will print
>
> ```
> {0.25: None, 1: '1', '2': 2}
> [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
> {'a', 'b'}
> ```
>
> Server process managers are more flexible than using shared memory objects
> because they can be made to support arbitrary object types. Also, a single
> manager can be shared by processes on different computers over a network.
> They are, however, slower than using shared memory.

### Using a pool of workers[¶](#using-a-pool-of-workers "Link to this heading")

The [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") class represents a pool of worker
processes. It has methods which allows tasks to be offloaded to the worker
processes in a few different ways.

For example:

```
from multiprocessing import Pool, TimeoutError
import time
import os

def f(x):
    return x*x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # start 4 worker processes
    with Pool(processes=4) as pool:

        # print "[0, 1, 4,..., 81]"
        print(pool.map(f, range(10)))

        # print same numbers in arbitrary order
        for i in pool.imap_unordered(f, range(10)):
            print(i)

        # evaluate "f(20)" asynchronously
        res = pool.apply_async(f, (20,))      # runs in *only* one process
        print(res.get(timeout=1))             # prints "400"

        # evaluate "os.getpid()" asynchronously
        res = pool.apply_async(os.getpid, ()) # runs in *only* one process
        print(res.get(timeout=1))             # prints the PID of that process

        # launching multiple evaluations asynchronously *may* use more processes
        multiple_results = [pool.apply_async(os.getpid, ()) for i in range(4)]
        print([res.get(timeout=1) for res in multiple_results])

        # make a single worker sleep for 10 seconds
        res = pool.apply_async(time.sleep, (10,))
        try:
            print(res.get(timeout=1))
        except TimeoutError:
            print("We lacked patience and got a multiprocessing.TimeoutError")

        print("For the moment, the pool remains available for more work")

    # exiting the 'with'-block has stopped the pool
    print("Now the pool is closed and no longer available")
```

Note that the methods of a pool should only ever be used by the
process which created it.

Note

Functionality within this package requires that the `__main__` module be
importable by the children. This is covered in [Programming guidelines](#multiprocessing-programming)
however it is worth pointing out here. This means that some examples, such
as the [`multiprocessing.pool.Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") examples will not work in the
interactive interpreter. For example:

```
>>> from multiprocessing import Pool
>>> p = Pool(5)
>>> def f(x):
...     return x*x
...
>>> with p:
...     p.map(f, [1,2,3])
Process PoolWorker-1:
Process PoolWorker-2:
Process PoolWorker-3:
Traceback (most recent call last):
Traceback (most recent call last):
Traceback (most recent call last):
AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'f' on <module '__main__' (<class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>)>
AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'f' on <module '__main__' (<class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>)>
AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'f' on <module '__main__' (<class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>)>
```

(If you try this it will actually output three full tracebacks
interleaved in a semi-random fashion, and then you may have to
stop the parent process somehow.)

## Reference[¶](#reference "Link to this heading")

The `multiprocessing` package mostly replicates the API of the
[`threading`](threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module.

### Global start method[¶](#global-start-method "Link to this heading")

Python supports several ways to create and initialize a process.
The global start method sets the default mechanism for creating a process.

Several multiprocessing functions and methods that may also instantiate
certain objects will implicitly set the global start method to the system’s default,
if it hasn’t been set already. The global start method can only be set once.
If you need to change the start method from the system default, you must
proactively set the global start method before calling functions or methods,
or creating these objects.

### [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") and exceptions[¶](#process-and-exceptions "Link to this heading")

*class* multiprocessing.Process(*group=None*, *target=None*, *name=None*, *args=()*, *kwargs={}*, *\**, *daemon=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.Process "Link to this definition")
:   Process objects represent activity that is run in a separate process. The
    [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") class has equivalents of all the methods of
    [`threading.Thread`](threading.html#threading.Thread "threading.Thread").

    The constructor should always be called with keyword arguments. *group*
    should always be `None`; it exists solely for compatibility with
    [`threading.Thread`](threading.html#threading.Thread "threading.Thread"). *target* is the callable object to be invoked by
    the [`run()`](#multiprocessing.Process.run "multiprocessing.Process.run") method. It defaults to `None`, meaning nothing is
    called. *name* is the process name (see [`name`](#multiprocessing.Process.name "multiprocessing.Process.name") for more details).
    *args* is the argument tuple for the target invocation. *kwargs* is a
    dictionary of keyword arguments for the target invocation. If provided,
    the keyword-only *daemon* argument sets the process [`daemon`](#multiprocessing.Process.daemon "multiprocessing.Process.daemon") flag
    to `True` or `False`. If `None` (the default), this flag will be
    inherited from the creating process.

    By default, no arguments are passed to *target*. The *args* argument,
    which defaults to `()`, can be used to specify a list or tuple of the arguments
    to pass to *target*.

    If a subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure it invokes the
    base class constructor (`super().__init__()`) before doing anything else
    to the process.

    Note

    In general, all arguments to [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") must be picklable. This is
    frequently observed when trying to create a [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") or use a
    [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor") from a REPL with a
    locally defined *target* function.

    Passing a callable object defined in the current REPL session causes the
    child process to die via an uncaught [`AttributeError`](exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError") exception when
    starting as *target* must have been defined within an importable module
    in order to be loaded during unpickling.

    Example of this uncatchable error from the child:

    ```
    >>> import multiprocessing as mp
    >>> def knigit():
    ...     print("Ni!")
    ...
    >>> process = mp.Process(target=knigit)
    >>> process.start()
    >>> Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ".../multiprocessing/spawn.py", line ..., in spawn_main
      File ".../multiprocessing/spawn.py", line ..., in _main
    AttributeError: module '__main__' has no attribute 'knigit'
    >>> process
    <SpawnProcess name='SpawnProcess-1' pid=379473 parent=378707 stopped exitcode=1>
    ```

    See [The spawn and forkserver start methods](#multiprocessing-programming-spawn). While this restriction is
    not true if using the `"fork"` start method, as of Python `3.14` that
    is no longer the default on any platform. See
    [Contexts and start methods](#multiprocessing-start-methods).
    See also [gh-132898](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132898).

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the *daemon* parameter.

    run()[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.run "Link to this definition")
    :   Method representing the process’s activity.

        You may override this method in a subclass. The standard [`run()`](#multiprocessing.Process.run "multiprocessing.Process.run")
        method invokes the callable object passed to the object’s constructor as
        the target argument, if any, with sequential and keyword arguments taken
        from the *args* and *kwargs* arguments, respectively.

        Using a list or tuple as the *args* argument passed to [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process")
        achieves the same effect.

        Example:

        ```
        >>> from multiprocessing import Process
        >>> p = Process(target=print, args=[1])
        >>> p.run()
        1
        >>> p = Process(target=print, args=(1,))
        >>> p.run()
        1
        ```

    start()[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.start "Link to this definition")
    :   Start the process’s activity.

        This must be called at most once per process object. It arranges for the
        object’s [`run()`](#multiprocessing.Process.run "multiprocessing.Process.run") method to be invoked in a separate process.

    join([*timeout*])[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.join "Link to this definition")
    :   If the optional argument *timeout* is `None` (the default), the method
        blocks until the process whose [`join()`](#multiprocessing.Process.join "multiprocessing.Process.join") method is called terminates.
        If *timeout* is a positive number, it blocks at most *timeout* seconds.
        Note that the method returns `None` if its process terminates or if the
        method times out. Check the process’s [`exitcode`](#multiprocessing.Process.exitcode "multiprocessing.Process.exitcode") to determine if
        it terminated.

        A process can be joined many times.

        A process cannot join itself because this would cause a deadlock. It is
        an error to attempt to join a process before it has been started.

    name[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.name "Link to this definition")
    :   The process’s name. The name is a string used for identification purposes
        only. It has no semantics. Multiple processes may be given the same
        name.

        The initial name is set by the constructor. If no explicit name is
        provided to the constructor, a name of the form
        ‘Process-N1:N2:…:Nk’ is constructed, where
        each Nk is the N-th child of its parent.

    is\_alive()[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.is_alive "Link to this definition")
    :   Return whether the process is alive.

        Roughly, a process object is alive from the moment the [`start()`](#multiprocessing.Process.start "multiprocessing.Process.start")
        method returns until the child process terminates.

    daemon[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.daemon "Link to this definition")
    :   The process’s daemon flag, a Boolean value. This must be set before
        [`start()`](#multiprocessing.Process.start "multiprocessing.Process.start") is called.

        The initial value is inherited from the creating process.

        When a process exits, it attempts to terminate all of its daemonic child
        processes.

        Note that a daemonic process is not allowed to create child processes.
        Otherwise a daemonic process would leave its children orphaned if it gets
        terminated when its parent process exits. Additionally, these are **not**
        Unix daemons or services, they are normal processes that will be
        terminated (and not joined) if non-daemonic processes have exited.

    In addition to the [`threading.Thread`](threading.html#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") API, [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") objects
    also support the following attributes and methods:

    pid[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.pid "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the process ID. Before the process is spawned, this will be
        `None`.

    exitcode[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.exitcode "Link to this definition")
    :   The child’s exit code. This will be `None` if the process has not yet
        terminated.

        If the child’s [`run()`](#multiprocessing.Process.run "multiprocessing.Process.run") method returned normally, the exit code
        will be 0. If it terminated via [`sys.exit()`](sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit") with an integer
        argument *N*, the exit code will be *N*.

        If the child terminated due to an exception not caught within
        [`run()`](#multiprocessing.Process.run "multiprocessing.Process.run"), the exit code will be 1. If it was terminated by
        signal *N*, the exit code will be the negative value *-N*.

    authkey[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.authkey "Link to this definition")
    :   The process’s authentication key (a byte string).

        When `multiprocessing` is initialized the main process is assigned a
        random string using [`os.urandom()`](os.html#os.urandom "os.urandom").

        When a [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") object is created, it will inherit the
        authentication key of its parent process, although this may be changed by
        setting [`authkey`](#multiprocessing.Process.authkey "multiprocessing.Process.authkey") to another byte string.

        See [Authentication keys](#multiprocessing-auth-keys).

    sentinel[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.sentinel "Link to this definition")
    :   A numeric handle of a system object which will become “ready” when
        the process ends.

        You can use this value if you want to wait on several events at
        once using [`multiprocessing.connection.wait()`](#multiprocessing.connection.wait "multiprocessing.connection.wait"). Otherwise
        calling [`join()`](#multiprocessing.Process.join "multiprocessing.Process.join") is simpler.

        On Windows, this is an OS handle usable with the `WaitForSingleObject`
        and `WaitForMultipleObjects` family of API calls. On POSIX, this is
        a file descriptor usable with primitives from the [`select`](select.html#module-select "select: Wait for I/O completion on multiple streams.") module.

        Added in version 3.3.

    interrupt()[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.interrupt "Link to this definition")
    :   Terminate the process. Works on POSIX using the [`SIGINT`](signal.html#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT") signal.
        Behavior on Windows is undefined.

        By default, this terminates the child process by raising [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt").
        This behavior can be altered by setting the respective signal handler in the child
        process [`signal.signal()`](signal.html#signal.signal "signal.signal") for [`SIGINT`](signal.html#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT").

        Note: if the child process catches and discards [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt"), the
        process will not be terminated.

        Note: the default behavior will also set [`exitcode`](#multiprocessing.Process.exitcode "multiprocessing.Process.exitcode") to `1` as if an
        uncaught exception was raised in the child process. To have a different
        [`exitcode`](#multiprocessing.Process.exitcode "multiprocessing.Process.exitcode") you may simply catch [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") and call
        `exit(your_code)`.

        Added in version 3.14.

    terminate()[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.terminate "Link to this definition")
    :   Terminate the process. On POSIX this is done using the [`SIGTERM`](signal.html#signal.SIGTERM "signal.SIGTERM") signal;
        on Windows `TerminateProcess()` is used. Note that exit handlers and
        finally clauses, etc., will not be executed.

        Note that descendant processes of the process will *not* be terminated –
        they will simply become orphaned.

        Warning

        If this method is used when the associated process is using a pipe or
        queue then the pipe or queue is liable to become corrupted and may
        become unusable by other process. Similarly, if the process has
        acquired a lock or semaphore etc. then terminating it is liable to
        cause other processes to deadlock.

    kill()[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.kill "Link to this definition")
    :   Same as [`terminate()`](#multiprocessing.Process.terminate "multiprocessing.Process.terminate") but using the `SIGKILL` signal on POSIX.

        Added in version 3.7.

    close()[¶](#multiprocessing.Process.close "Link to this definition")
    :   Close the [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") object, releasing all resources associated
        with it. [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if the underlying process
        is still running. Once [`close()`](#multiprocessing.Process.close "multiprocessing.Process.close") returns successfully, most
        other methods and attributes of the [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") object will
        raise [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").

        Added in version 3.7.

    Note that the [`start()`](#multiprocessing.Process.start "multiprocessing.Process.start"), [`join()`](#multiprocessing.Process.join "multiprocessing.Process.join"), [`is_alive()`](#multiprocessing.Process.is_alive "multiprocessing.Process.is_alive"),
    [`terminate()`](#multiprocessing.Process.terminate "multiprocessing.Process.terminate") and [`exitcode`](#multiprocessing.Process.exitcode "multiprocessing.Process.exitcode") methods should only be called by
    the process that created the process object.

    Example usage of some of the methods of [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process"):

    ```
    >>> import multiprocessing, time, signal
    >>> mp_context = multiprocessing.get_context('spawn')
    >>> p = mp_context.Process(target=time.sleep, args=(1000,))
    >>> print(p, p.is_alive())
    <...Process ... initial> False
    >>> p.start()
    >>> print(p, p.is_alive())
    <...Process ... started> True
    >>> p.terminate()
    >>> time.sleep(0.1)
    >>> print(p, p.is_alive())
    <...Process ... stopped exitcode=-SIGTERM> False
    >>> p.exitcode == -signal.SIGTERM
    True
    ```

*exception* multiprocessing.ProcessError[¶](#multiprocessing.ProcessError "Link to this definition")
:   The base class of all `multiprocessing` exceptions.

*exception* multiprocessing.BufferTooShort[¶](#multiprocessing.BufferTooShort "Link to this definition")
:   Exception raised by `Connection.recv_bytes_into()` when the supplied
    buffer object is too small for the message read.

    If `e` is an instance of [`BufferTooShort`](#multiprocessing.BufferTooShort "multiprocessing.BufferTooShort") then `e.args[0]` will give
    the message as a byte string.

*exception* multiprocessing.AuthenticationError[¶](#multiprocessing.AuthenticationError "Link to this definition")
:   Raised when there is an authentication error.

*exception* multiprocessing.TimeoutError[¶](#multiprocessing.TimeoutError "Link to this definition")
:   Raised by methods with a timeout when the timeout expires.

### Pipes and Queues[¶](#pipes-and-queues "Link to this heading")

When using multiple processes, one generally uses message passing for
communication between processes and avoids having to use any synchronization
primitives like locks.

For passing messages one can use [`Pipe()`](#multiprocessing.Pipe "multiprocessing.Pipe") (for a connection between two
processes) or a queue (which allows multiple producers and consumers).

The [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue"), [`SimpleQueue`](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue "multiprocessing.SimpleQueue") and [`JoinableQueue`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue") types
are multi-producer, multi-consumer FIFO
queues modelled on the [`queue.Queue`](queue.html#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") class in the
standard library. They differ in that [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue") lacks the
[`task_done()`](queue.html#queue.Queue.task_done "queue.Queue.task_done") and [`join()`](queue.html#queue.Queue.join "queue.Queue.join") methods introduced
into Python 2.5’s [`queue.Queue`](queue.html#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") class.

If you use [`JoinableQueue`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue") then you **must** call
[`JoinableQueue.task_done()`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done") for each task removed from the queue or else the
semaphore used to count the number of unfinished tasks may eventually overflow,
raising an exception.

One difference from other Python queue implementations, is that `multiprocessing`
queues serializes all objects that are put into them using [`pickle`](pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.").
The object returned by the get method is a re-created object that does not share
memory with the original object.

Note that one can also create a shared queue by using a manager object – see
[Managers](#multiprocessing-managers).

Note

`multiprocessing` uses the usual [`queue.Empty`](queue.html#queue.Empty "queue.Empty") and
[`queue.Full`](queue.html#queue.Full "queue.Full") exceptions to signal a timeout. They are not available in
the `multiprocessing` namespace so you need to import them from
[`queue`](queue.html#module-queue "queue: A synchronized queue class.").

Note

When an object is put on a queue, the object is pickled and a
background thread later flushes the pickled data to an underlying
pipe. This has some consequences which are a little surprising,
but should not cause any practical difficulties – if they really
bother you then you can instead use a queue created with a
[manager](#multiprocessing-managers).

1. After putting an object on an empty queue there may be an
   infinitesimal delay before the queue’s [`empty()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.empty "multiprocessing.Queue.empty")
   method returns [`False`](constants.html#False "False") and [`get_nowait()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.get_nowait "multiprocessing.Queue.get_nowait") can
   return without raising [`queue.Empty`](queue.html#queue.Empty "queue.Empty").
2. If multiple processes are enqueuing objects, it is possible for
   the objects to be received at the other end out-of-order.
   However, objects enqueued by the same process will always be in
   the expected order with respect to each other.

Warning

If a process is killed using [`Process.terminate()`](#multiprocessing.Process.terminate "multiprocessing.Process.terminate") or [`os.kill()`](os.html#os.kill "os.kill")
while it is trying to use a [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue"), then the data in the queue is
likely to become corrupted. This may cause any other process to get an
exception when it tries to use the queue later on.

Warning

As mentioned above, if a child process has put items on a queue (and it has
not used [`JoinableQueue.cancel_join_thread`](#multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread "multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread")), then that process will
not terminate until all buffered items have been flushed to the pipe.

This means that if you try joining that process you may get a deadlock unless
you are sure that all items which have been put on the queue have been
consumed. Similarly, if the child process is non-daemonic then the parent
process may hang on exit when it tries to join all its non-daemonic children.

Note that a queue created using a manager does not have this issue. See
[Programming guidelines](#multiprocessing-programming).

For an example of the usage of queues for interprocess communication see
[Examples](#multiprocessing-examples).

multiprocessing.Pipe(*duplex=True*)[¶](#multiprocessing.Pipe "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a pair `(conn1, conn2)` of
    [`Connection`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection "multiprocessing.connection.Connection") objects representing the
    ends of a pipe.

    If *duplex* is `True` (the default) then the pipe is bidirectional. If
    *duplex* is `False` then the pipe is unidirectional: `conn1` can only be
    used for receiving messages and `conn2` can only be used for sending
    messages.

    The `send()` method serializes the object using
    [`pickle`](pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") and the `recv()` re-creates the object.

*class* multiprocessing.Queue([*maxsize*])[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a process shared queue implemented using a pipe and a few
    locks/semaphores. When a process first puts an item on the queue a feeder
    thread is started which transfers objects from a buffer into the pipe.

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    The usual [`queue.Empty`](queue.html#queue.Empty "queue.Empty") and [`queue.Full`](queue.html#queue.Full "queue.Full") exceptions from the
    standard library’s [`queue`](queue.html#module-queue "queue: A synchronized queue class.") module are raised to signal timeouts.

    [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue") implements all the methods of [`queue.Queue`](queue.html#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") except for
    [`task_done()`](queue.html#queue.Queue.task_done "queue.Queue.task_done") and [`join()`](queue.html#queue.Queue.join "queue.Queue.join").

    qsize()[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.qsize "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the approximate size of the queue. Because of
        multithreading/multiprocessing semantics, this number is not reliable.

        Note that this may raise [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError") on platforms like
        macOS where `sem_getvalue()` is not implemented.

    empty()[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.empty "Link to this definition")
    :   Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. Because of
        multithreading/multiprocessing semantics, this is not reliable.

        May raise an [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") on closed queues. (not guaranteed)

    full()[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.full "Link to this definition")
    :   Return `True` if the queue is full, `False` otherwise. Because of
        multithreading/multiprocessing semantics, this is not reliable.

    put(*obj*[, *block*[, *timeout*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.put "Link to this definition")
    :   Put obj into the queue. If the optional argument *block* is `True`
        (the default) and *timeout* is `None` (the default), block if necessary until
        a free slot is available. If *timeout* is a positive number, it blocks at
        most *timeout* seconds and raises the [`queue.Full`](queue.html#queue.Full "queue.Full") exception if no
        free slot was available within that time. Otherwise (*block* is
        `False`), put an item on the queue if a free slot is immediately
        available, else raise the [`queue.Full`](queue.html#queue.Full "queue.Full") exception (*timeout* is
        ignored in that case).

        Changed in version 3.8: If the queue is closed, [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised instead of
        [`AssertionError`](exceptions.html#AssertionError "AssertionError").

    put\_nowait(*obj*)[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.put_nowait "Link to this definition")
    :   Equivalent to `put(obj, False)`.

    get([*block*[, *timeout*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.get "Link to this definition")
    :   Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args *block* is
        `True` (the default) and *timeout* is `None` (the default), block if
        necessary until an item is available. If *timeout* is a positive number,
        it blocks at most *timeout* seconds and raises the [`queue.Empty`](queue.html#queue.Empty "queue.Empty")
        exception if no item was available within that time. Otherwise (block is
        `False`), return an item if one is immediately available, else raise the
        [`queue.Empty`](queue.html#queue.Empty "queue.Empty") exception (*timeout* is ignored in that case).

        Changed in version 3.8: If the queue is closed, [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised instead of
        [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").

    get\_nowait()[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.get_nowait "Link to this definition")
    :   Equivalent to `get(False)`.

    [`multiprocessing.Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue") has a few additional methods not found in
    [`queue.Queue`](queue.html#queue.Queue "queue.Queue"). These methods are usually unnecessary for most
    code:

    close()[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.close "Link to this definition")
    :   Close the queue: release internal resources.

        A queue must not be used anymore after it is closed. For example,
        [`get()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.get "multiprocessing.Queue.get"), [`put()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.put "multiprocessing.Queue.put") and [`empty()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.empty "multiprocessing.Queue.empty")
        methods must no longer be called.

        The background thread will quit once it has flushed all buffered
        data to the pipe. This is called automatically when the queue is garbage
        collected.

    join\_thread()[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread "Link to this definition")
    :   Join the background thread. This can only be used after [`close()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.close "multiprocessing.Queue.close") has
        been called. It blocks until the background thread exits, ensuring that
        all data in the buffer has been flushed to the pipe.

        By default if a process is not the creator of the queue then on exit it
        will attempt to join the queue’s background thread. The process can call
        [`cancel_join_thread()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread "multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread") to make [`join_thread()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread "multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread") do nothing.

    cancel\_join\_thread()[¶](#multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread "Link to this definition")
    :   Prevent [`join_thread()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread "multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread") from blocking. In particular, this prevents
        the background thread from being joined automatically when the process
        exits – see [`join_thread()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread "multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread").

        A better name for this method might be
        `allow_exit_without_flush()`. It is likely to cause enqueued
        data to be lost, and you almost certainly will not need to use it.
        It is really only there if you need the current process to exit
        immediately without waiting to flush enqueued data to the
        underlying pipe, and you don’t care about lost data.

    Note

    This class’s functionality requires a functioning shared semaphore
    implementation on the host operating system. Without one, the
    functionality in this class will be disabled, and attempts to
    instantiate a [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue") will result in an [`ImportError`](exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError"). See
    [bpo-3770](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=3770) for additional information. The same holds true for any
    of the specialized queue types listed below.

*class* multiprocessing.SimpleQueue[¶](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue "Link to this definition")
:   It is a simplified [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue") type, very close to a locked [`Pipe`](#multiprocessing.Pipe "multiprocessing.Pipe").

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    close()[¶](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.close "Link to this definition")
    :   Close the queue: release internal resources.

        A queue must not be used anymore after it is closed. For example,
        [`get()`](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.get "multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.get"), [`put()`](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.put "multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.put") and [`empty()`](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.empty "multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.empty") methods must no longer be
        called.

        Added in version 3.9.

    empty()[¶](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.empty "Link to this definition")
    :   Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise.

        Always raises an [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") if the SimpleQueue is closed.

    get()[¶](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.get "Link to this definition")
    :   Remove and return an item from the queue.

    put(*item*)[¶](#multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.put "Link to this definition")
    :   Put *item* into the queue.

*class* multiprocessing.JoinableQueue([*maxsize*])[¶](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue "Link to this definition")
:   [`JoinableQueue`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue"), a [`Queue`](#multiprocessing.Queue "multiprocessing.Queue") subclass, is a queue which
    additionally has [`task_done()`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done") and [`join()`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.join "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.join") methods.

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    task\_done()[¶](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done "Link to this definition")
    :   Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete. Used by queue
        consumers. For each [`get()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.get "multiprocessing.Queue.get") used to fetch a task, a subsequent
        call to [`task_done()`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done") tells the queue that the processing on the task
        is complete.

        If a [`join()`](queue.html#queue.Queue.join "queue.Queue.join") is currently blocking, it will resume when all
        items have been processed (meaning that a [`task_done()`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done") call was
        received for every item that had been [`put()`](#multiprocessing.Queue.put "multiprocessing.Queue.put") into the queue).

        Raises a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if called more times than there were items
        placed in the queue.

    join()[¶](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.join "Link to this definition")
    :   Block until all items in the queue have been gotten and processed.

        The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the
        queue. The count goes down whenever a consumer calls
        [`task_done()`](#multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done "multiprocessing.JoinableQueue.task_done") to indicate that the item was retrieved and all work on
        it is complete. When the count of unfinished tasks drops to zero,
        [`join()`](queue.html#queue.Queue.join "queue.Queue.join") unblocks.

### Miscellaneous[¶](#miscellaneous "Link to this heading")

multiprocessing.active\_children()[¶](#multiprocessing.active_children "Link to this definition")
:   Return list of all live children of the current process.

    Calling this has the side effect of “joining” any processes which have
    already finished.

multiprocessing.cpu\_count()[¶](#multiprocessing.cpu_count "Link to this definition")
:   Return the number of CPUs in the system.

    This number is not equivalent to the number of CPUs the current process can
    use. The number of usable CPUs can be obtained with
    [`os.process_cpu_count()`](os.html#os.process_cpu_count "os.process_cpu_count") (or `len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))`).

    When the number of CPUs cannot be determined a [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError")
    is raised.

    See also

    [`os.cpu_count()`](os.html#os.cpu_count "os.cpu_count")
    [`os.process_cpu_count()`](os.html#os.process_cpu_count "os.process_cpu_count")

    Changed in version 3.13: The return value can also be overridden using the
    [`-X cpu_count`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) flag or [`PYTHON_CPU_COUNT`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_CPU_COUNT) as this is
    merely a wrapper around the [`os`](os.html#module-os "os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.") cpu count APIs.

multiprocessing.current\_process()[¶](#multiprocessing.current_process "Link to this definition")
:   Return the [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") object corresponding to the current process.

    An analogue of [`threading.current_thread()`](threading.html#threading.current_thread "threading.current_thread").

multiprocessing.parent\_process()[¶](#multiprocessing.parent_process "Link to this definition")
:   Return the [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") object corresponding to the parent process of
    the [`current_process()`](#multiprocessing.current_process "multiprocessing.current_process"). For the main process, `parent_process` will
    be `None`.

    Added in version 3.8.

multiprocessing.freeze\_support()[¶](#multiprocessing.freeze_support "Link to this definition")
:   Add support for when a program which uses `multiprocessing` has been
    frozen to produce an executable. (Has been tested with **py2exe**,
    **PyInstaller** and **cx\_Freeze**.)

    One needs to call this function straight after the `if __name__ ==
    '__main__'` line of the main module. For example:

    ```
    from multiprocessing import Process, freeze_support

    def f():
        print('hello world!')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        freeze_support()
        Process(target=f).start()
    ```

    If the `freeze_support()` line is omitted then trying to run the frozen
    executable will raise [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError").

    Calling `freeze_support()` has no effect when the start method is not
    *spawn*. In addition, if the module is being run normally by the Python
    interpreter (the program has not been frozen), then `freeze_support()`
    has no effect.

multiprocessing.get\_all\_start\_methods()[¶](#multiprocessing.get_all_start_methods "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a list of the supported start methods, the first of which
    is the default. The possible start methods are `'fork'`,
    `'spawn'` and `'forkserver'`. Not all platforms support all
    methods. See [Contexts and start methods](#multiprocessing-start-methods).

    Added in version 3.4.

multiprocessing.get\_context(*method=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.get_context "Link to this definition")
:   Return a context object which has the same attributes as the
    `multiprocessing` module.

    If *method* is `None` then the default context is returned. Note that if
    the global start method has not been set, this will set it to the system default
    See [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.
    Otherwise *method* should be `'fork'`, `'spawn'`,
    `'forkserver'`. [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if the specified
    start method is not available. See [Contexts and start methods](#multiprocessing-start-methods).

    Added in version 3.4.

multiprocessing.get\_start\_method(*allow\_none=False*)[¶](#multiprocessing.get_start_method "Link to this definition")
:   Return the name of start method used for starting processes.

    If the global start method is not set and *allow\_none* is `False`, the global start
    method is set to the default, and its name is returned. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    The return value can be `'fork'`, `'spawn'`, `'forkserver'`
    or `None`. See [Contexts and start methods](#multiprocessing-start-methods).

    Added in version 3.4.

    Changed in version 3.8: On macOS, the *spawn* start method is now the default. The *fork* start
    method should be considered unsafe as it can lead to crashes of the
    subprocess. See [bpo-33725](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33725).

multiprocessing.set\_executable(*executable*)[¶](#multiprocessing.set_executable "Link to this definition")
:   Set the path of the Python interpreter to use when starting a child process.
    (By default [`sys.executable`](sys.html#sys.executable "sys.executable") is used). Embedders will probably need to
    do something like

    ```
    set_executable(os.path.join(sys.exec_prefix, 'pythonw.exe'))
    ```

    before they can create child processes.

    Changed in version 3.4: Now supported on POSIX when the `'spawn'` start method is used.

    Changed in version 3.11: Accepts a [path-like object](../glossary.html#term-path-like-object).

multiprocessing.set\_forkserver\_preload(*module\_names*)[¶](#multiprocessing.set_forkserver_preload "Link to this definition")
:   Set a list of module names for the forkserver main process to attempt to
    import so that their already imported state is inherited by forked
    processes. Any [`ImportError`](exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") when doing so is silently ignored.
    This can be used as a performance enhancement to avoid repeated work
    in every process.

    For this to work, it must be called before the forkserver process has been
    launched (before creating a `Pool` or starting a [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process")).

    Only meaningful when using the `'forkserver'` start method.
    See [Contexts and start methods](#multiprocessing-start-methods).

    Added in version 3.4.

multiprocessing.set\_start\_method(*method*, *force=False*)[¶](#multiprocessing.set_start_method "Link to this definition")
:   Set the method which should be used to start child processes.
    The *method* argument can be `'fork'`, `'spawn'` or `'forkserver'`.
    Raises [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") if the start method has already been set and *force*
    is not `True`. If *method* is `None` and *force* is `True` then the start
    method is set to `None`. If *method* is `None` and *force* is `False`
    then the context is set to the default context.

    Note that this should be called at most once, and it should be
    protected inside the `if __name__ == '__main__'` clause of the
    main module.

    See [Contexts and start methods](#multiprocessing-start-methods).

    Added in version 3.4.

Note

`multiprocessing` contains no analogues of
[`threading.active_count()`](threading.html#threading.active_count "threading.active_count"), [`threading.enumerate()`](threading.html#threading.enumerate "threading.enumerate"),
[`threading.settrace()`](threading.html#threading.settrace "threading.settrace"), [`threading.setprofile()`](threading.html#threading.setprofile "threading.setprofile"),
[`threading.Timer`](threading.html#threading.Timer "threading.Timer"), or [`threading.local`](threading.html#threading.local "threading.local").

### Connection Objects[¶](#connection-objects "Link to this heading")

Connection objects allow the sending and receiving of picklable objects or
strings. They can be thought of as message oriented connected sockets.

Connection objects are usually created using
[`Pipe`](#multiprocessing.Pipe "multiprocessing.Pipe") – see also
[Listeners and Clients](#multiprocessing-listeners-clients).

*class* multiprocessing.connection.Connection[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection "Link to this definition")
:   send(*obj*)[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send "Link to this definition")
    :   Send an object to the other end of the connection which should be read
        using [`recv()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv").

        The object must be picklable. Very large pickles (approximately 32 MiB+,
        though it depends on the OS) may raise a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") exception.

    recv()[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv "Link to this definition")
    :   Return an object sent from the other end of the connection using
        [`send()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send"). Blocks until there is something to receive. Raises
        [`EOFError`](exceptions.html#EOFError "EOFError") if there is nothing left to receive
        and the other end was closed.

    fileno()[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.fileno "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the file descriptor or handle used by the connection.

    close()[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.close "Link to this definition")
    :   Close the connection.

        This is called automatically when the connection is garbage collected.

    poll([*timeout*])[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.poll "Link to this definition")
    :   Return whether there is any data available to be read.

        If *timeout* is not specified then it will return immediately. If
        *timeout* is a number then this specifies the maximum time in seconds to
        block. If *timeout* is `None` then an infinite timeout is used.

        Note that multiple connection objects may be polled at once by
        using [`multiprocessing.connection.wait()`](#multiprocessing.connection.wait "multiprocessing.connection.wait").

    send\_bytes(*buffer*[, *offset*[, *size*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send_bytes "Link to this definition")
    :   Send byte data from a [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object) as a complete message.

        If *offset* is given then data is read from that position in *buffer*. If
        *size* is given then that many bytes will be read from buffer. Very large
        buffers (approximately 32 MiB+, though it depends on the OS) may raise a
        [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") exception

    recv\_bytes([*maxlength*])[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv_bytes "Link to this definition")
    :   Return a complete message of byte data sent from the other end of the
        connection as a string. Blocks until there is something to receive.
        Raises [`EOFError`](exceptions.html#EOFError "EOFError") if there is nothing left
        to receive and the other end has closed.

        If *maxlength* is specified and the message is longer than *maxlength*
        then [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") is raised and the connection will no longer be
        readable.

        Changed in version 3.3: This function used to raise [`IOError`](exceptions.html#IOError "IOError"), which is now an
        alias of [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").

    recv\_bytes\_into(*buffer*[, *offset*])[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv_bytes_into "Link to this definition")
    :   Read into *buffer* a complete message of byte data sent from the other end
        of the connection and return the number of bytes in the message. Blocks
        until there is something to receive. Raises
        [`EOFError`](exceptions.html#EOFError "EOFError") if there is nothing left to receive and the other end was
        closed.

        *buffer* must be a writable [bytes-like object](../glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object). If
        *offset* is given then the message will be written into the buffer from
        that position. Offset must be a non-negative integer less than the
        length of *buffer* (in bytes).

        If the buffer is too short then a `BufferTooShort` exception is
        raised and the complete message is available as `e.args[0]` where `e`
        is the exception instance.

    Changed in version 3.3: Connection objects themselves can now be transferred between processes
    using [`Connection.send()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send") and [`Connection.recv()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv").

    Connection objects also now support the context management protocol – see
    [Context Manager Types](stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager). [`__enter__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__enter__ "contextmanager.__enter__") returns the
    connection object, and [`__exit__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__exit__ "contextmanager.__exit__") calls [`close()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.close "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.close").

For example:

```
>>> from multiprocessing import Pipe
>>> a, b = Pipe()
>>> a.send([1, 'hello', None])
>>> b.recv()
[1, 'hello', None]
>>> b.send_bytes(b'thank you')
>>> a.recv_bytes()
b'thank you'
>>> import array
>>> arr1 = array.array('i', range(5))
>>> arr2 = array.array('i', [0] * 10)
>>> a.send_bytes(arr1)
>>> count = b.recv_bytes_into(arr2)
>>> assert count == len(arr1) * arr1.itemsize
>>> arr2
array('i', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
```

Warning

The [`Connection.recv()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv") method automatically unpickles the data it
receives, which can be a security risk unless you can trust the process
which sent the message.

Therefore, unless the connection object was produced using `Pipe()` you
should only use the [`recv()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv") and [`send()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.send")
methods after performing some sort of authentication. See
[Authentication keys](#multiprocessing-auth-keys).

Warning

If a process is killed while it is trying to read or write to a pipe then
the data in the pipe is likely to become corrupted, because it may become
impossible to be sure where the message boundaries lie.

### Synchronization primitives[¶](#synchronization-primitives "Link to this heading")

Generally synchronization primitives are not as necessary in a multiprocess
program as they are in a multithreaded program. See the documentation for
[`threading`](threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module.

Note that one can also create synchronization primitives by using a manager
object – see [Managers](#multiprocessing-managers).

*class* multiprocessing.Barrier(*parties*[, *action*[, *timeout*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.Barrier "Link to this definition")
:   A barrier object: a clone of [`threading.Barrier`](threading.html#threading.Barrier "threading.Barrier").

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    Added in version 3.3.

*class* multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore([*value*])[¶](#multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore "Link to this definition")
:   A bounded semaphore object: a close analog of
    [`threading.BoundedSemaphore`](threading.html#threading.BoundedSemaphore "threading.BoundedSemaphore").

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    A solitary difference from its close analog exists: its `acquire` method’s
    first argument is named *block*, as is consistent with [`Lock.acquire()`](#multiprocessing.Lock.acquire "multiprocessing.Lock.acquire").

    locked()[¶](#multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore.locked "Link to this definition")
    :   Return a boolean indicating whether this object is locked right now.

        Added in version 3.14.

    Note

    On macOS, this is indistinguishable from [`Semaphore`](#multiprocessing.Semaphore "multiprocessing.Semaphore") because
    `sem_getvalue()` is not implemented on that platform.

*class* multiprocessing.Condition([*lock*])[¶](#multiprocessing.Condition "Link to this definition")
:   A condition variable: an alias for [`threading.Condition`](threading.html#threading.Condition "threading.Condition").

    If *lock* is specified then it should be a [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") or [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock")
    object from `multiprocessing`.

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    Changed in version 3.3: The [`wait_for()`](threading.html#threading.Condition.wait_for "threading.Condition.wait_for") method was added.

*class* multiprocessing.Event[¶](#multiprocessing.Event "Link to this definition")
:   A clone of [`threading.Event`](threading.html#threading.Event "threading.Event").

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

*class* multiprocessing.Lock[¶](#multiprocessing.Lock "Link to this definition")
:   A non-recursive lock object: a close analog of [`threading.Lock`](threading.html#threading.Lock "threading.Lock").
    Once a process or thread has acquired a lock, subsequent attempts to
    acquire it from any process or thread will block until it is released;
    any process or thread may release it. The concepts and behaviors of
    [`threading.Lock`](threading.html#threading.Lock "threading.Lock") as it applies to threads are replicated here in
    [`multiprocessing.Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") as it applies to either processes or threads,
    except as noted.

    Note that [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") is actually a factory function which returns an
    instance of `multiprocessing.synchronize.Lock` initialized with a
    default context.

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") supports the [context manager](../glossary.html#term-context-manager) protocol and thus may be
    used in [`with`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements.

    acquire(*block=True*, *timeout=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.Lock.acquire "Link to this definition")
    :   Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

        With the *block* argument set to `True` (the default), the method call
        will block until the lock is in an unlocked state, then set it to locked
        and return `True`. Note that the name of this first argument differs
        from that in [`threading.Lock.acquire()`](threading.html#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire").

        With the *block* argument set to `False`, the method call does not
        block. If the lock is currently in a locked state, return `False`;
        otherwise set the lock to a locked state and return `True`.

        When invoked with a positive, floating-point value for *timeout*, block
        for at most the number of seconds specified by *timeout* as long as
        the lock can not be acquired. Invocations with a negative value for
        *timeout* are equivalent to a *timeout* of zero. Invocations with a
        *timeout* value of `None` (the default) set the timeout period to
        infinite. Note that the treatment of negative or `None` values for
        *timeout* differs from the implemented behavior in
        [`threading.Lock.acquire()`](threading.html#threading.Lock.acquire "threading.Lock.acquire"). The *timeout* argument has no practical
        implications if the *block* argument is set to `False` and is thus
        ignored. Returns `True` if the lock has been acquired or `False` if
        the timeout period has elapsed.

    release()[¶](#multiprocessing.Lock.release "Link to this definition")
    :   Release a lock. This can be called from any process or thread, not only
        the process or thread which originally acquired the lock.

        Behavior is the same as in [`threading.Lock.release()`](threading.html#threading.Lock.release "threading.Lock.release") except that
        when invoked on an unlocked lock, a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised.

    locked()[¶](#multiprocessing.Lock.locked "Link to this definition")
    :   Return a boolean indicating whether this object is locked right now.

        Added in version 3.14.

*class* multiprocessing.RLock[¶](#multiprocessing.RLock "Link to this definition")
:   A recursive lock object: a close analog of [`threading.RLock`](threading.html#threading.RLock "threading.RLock"). A
    recursive lock must be released by the process or thread that acquired it.
    Once a process or thread has acquired a recursive lock, the same process
    or thread may acquire it again without blocking; that process or thread
    must release it once for each time it has been acquired.

    Note that [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock") is actually a factory function which returns an
    instance of `multiprocessing.synchronize.RLock` initialized with a
    default context.

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock") supports the [context manager](../glossary.html#term-context-manager) protocol and thus may be
    used in [`with`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statements.

    acquire(*block=True*, *timeout=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.RLock.acquire "Link to this definition")
    :   Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

        When invoked with the *block* argument set to `True`, block until the
        lock is in an unlocked state (not owned by any process or thread) unless
        the lock is already owned by the current process or thread. The current
        process or thread then takes ownership of the lock (if it does not
        already have ownership) and the recursion level inside the lock increments
        by one, resulting in a return value of `True`. Note that there are
        several differences in this first argument’s behavior compared to the
        implementation of [`threading.RLock.acquire()`](threading.html#threading.RLock.acquire "threading.RLock.acquire"), starting with the name
        of the argument itself.

        When invoked with the *block* argument set to `False`, do not block.
        If the lock has already been acquired (and thus is owned) by another
        process or thread, the current process or thread does not take ownership
        and the recursion level within the lock is not changed, resulting in
        a return value of `False`. If the lock is in an unlocked state, the
        current process or thread takes ownership and the recursion level is
        incremented, resulting in a return value of `True`.

        Use and behaviors of the *timeout* argument are the same as in
        [`Lock.acquire()`](#multiprocessing.Lock.acquire "multiprocessing.Lock.acquire"). Note that some of these behaviors of *timeout*
        differ from the implemented behaviors in [`threading.RLock.acquire()`](threading.html#threading.RLock.acquire "threading.RLock.acquire").

    release()[¶](#multiprocessing.RLock.release "Link to this definition")
    :   Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level. If after the
        decrement the recursion level is zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not
        owned by any process or thread) and if any other processes or threads
        are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one
        of them to proceed. If after the decrement the recursion level is still
        nonzero, the lock remains locked and owned by the calling process or
        thread.

        Only call this method when the calling process or thread owns the lock.
        An [`AssertionError`](exceptions.html#AssertionError "AssertionError") is raised if this method is called by a process
        or thread other than the owner or if the lock is in an unlocked (unowned)
        state. Note that the type of exception raised in this situation
        differs from the implemented behavior in [`threading.RLock.release()`](threading.html#threading.RLock.release "threading.RLock.release").

    locked()[¶](#multiprocessing.RLock.locked "Link to this definition")
    :   Return a boolean indicating whether this object is locked right now.

        Added in version 3.14.

*class* multiprocessing.Semaphore([*value*])[¶](#multiprocessing.Semaphore "Link to this definition")
:   A semaphore object: a close analog of [`threading.Semaphore`](threading.html#threading.Semaphore "threading.Semaphore").

    Instantiating this class may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    A solitary difference from its close analog exists: its `acquire` method’s
    first argument is named *block*, as is consistent with [`Lock.acquire()`](#multiprocessing.Lock.acquire "multiprocessing.Lock.acquire").

    get\_value()[¶](#multiprocessing.Semaphore.get_value "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the current value of semaphore.

        Note that this may raise [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError") on platforms like
        macOS where `sem_getvalue()` is not implemented.

    locked()[¶](#multiprocessing.Semaphore.locked "Link to this definition")
    :   Return a boolean indicating whether this object is locked right now.

        Added in version 3.14.

Note

On macOS, `sem_timedwait` is unsupported, so calling `acquire()` with
a timeout will emulate that function’s behavior using a sleeping loop.

Note

Some of this package’s functionality requires a functioning shared semaphore
implementation on the host operating system. Without one, the
`multiprocessing.synchronize` module will be disabled, and attempts to
import it will result in an [`ImportError`](exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError"). See
[bpo-3770](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=3770) for additional information.

### Shared [`ctypes`](ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python.") Objects[¶](#shared-ctypes-objects "Link to this heading")

It is possible to create shared objects using shared memory which can be
inherited by child processes.

multiprocessing.Value(*typecode\_or\_type*, *\*args*, *lock=True*)[¶](#multiprocessing.Value "Link to this definition")
:   Return a [`ctypes`](ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python.") object allocated from shared memory. By default the
    return value is actually a synchronized wrapper for the object. The object
    itself can be accessed via the *value* attribute of a [`Value`](#multiprocessing.Value "multiprocessing.Value").

    *typecode\_or\_type* determines the type of the returned object: it is either a
    ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by the [`array`](array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values.")
    module. *\*args* is passed on to the constructor for the type.

    If *lock* is `True` (the default) then a new recursive lock
    object is created to synchronize access to the value. If *lock* is
    a [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") or [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock") object then that will be used to
    synchronize access to the value. If *lock* is `False` then
    access to the returned object will not be automatically protected
    by a lock, so it will not necessarily be “process-safe”.

    Operations like `+=` which involve a read and write are not
    atomic. So if, for instance, you want to atomically increment a
    shared value it is insufficient to just do

    ```
    counter.value += 1
    ```

    Assuming the associated lock is recursive (which it is by default)
    you can instead do

    ```
    with counter.get_lock():
        counter.value += 1
    ```

    Note that *lock* is a keyword-only argument.

multiprocessing.Array(*typecode\_or\_type*, *size\_or\_initializer*, *\**, *lock=True*)[¶](#multiprocessing.Array "Link to this definition")
:   Return a ctypes array allocated from shared memory. By default the return
    value is actually a synchronized wrapper for the array.

    *typecode\_or\_type* determines the type of the elements of the returned array:
    it is either a [ctypes type](ctypes.html#ctypes-fundamental-data-types) or a one
    character typecode of the kind used by the [`array`](array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values.") module with the
    exception of `'w'`, which is not supported. In addition, the `'c'`
    typecode is an alias for [`ctypes.c_char`](ctypes.html#ctypes.c_char "ctypes.c_char"). If *size\_or\_initializer*
    is an integer, then it determines the length of the array, and the array
    will be initially zeroed. Otherwise, *size\_or\_initializer* is a sequence
    which is used to initialize the array and whose length determines the length
    of the array.

    If *lock* is `True` (the default) then a new lock object is created to
    synchronize access to the value. If *lock* is a [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") or
    [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock") object then that will be used to synchronize access to the
    value. If *lock* is `False` then access to the returned object will not be
    automatically protected by a lock, so it will not necessarily be
    “process-safe”.

    Note that *lock* is a keyword only argument.

    Note that an array of [`ctypes.c_char`](ctypes.html#ctypes.c_char "ctypes.c_char") has *value* and *raw*
    attributes which allow one to use it to store and retrieve strings.

#### The `multiprocessing.sharedctypes` module[¶](#module-multiprocessing.sharedctypes "Link to this heading")

The `multiprocessing.sharedctypes` module provides functions for allocating
[`ctypes`](ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python.") objects from shared memory which can be inherited by child
processes.

Note

Although it is possible to store a pointer in shared memory remember that
this will refer to a location in the address space of a specific process.
However, the pointer is quite likely to be invalid in the context of a second
process and trying to dereference the pointer from the second process may
cause a crash.

multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawArray(*typecode\_or\_type*, *size\_or\_initializer*)[¶](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawArray "Link to this definition")
:   Return a ctypes array allocated from shared memory.

    *typecode\_or\_type* determines the type of the elements of the returned array:
    it is either a ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by
    the [`array`](array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values.") module. If *size\_or\_initializer* is an integer then it
    determines the length of the array, and the array will be initially zeroed.
    Otherwise *size\_or\_initializer* is a sequence which is used to initialize the
    array and whose length determines the length of the array.

    Note that setting and getting an element is potentially non-atomic – use
    [`Array()`](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Array "multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Array") instead to make sure that access is automatically synchronized
    using a lock.

multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawValue(*typecode\_or\_type*, *\*args*)[¶](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawValue "Link to this definition")
:   Return a ctypes object allocated from shared memory.

    *typecode\_or\_type* determines the type of the returned object: it is either a
    ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by the [`array`](array.html#module-array "array: Space efficient arrays of uniformly typed numeric values.")
    module. *\*args* is passed on to the constructor for the type.

    Note that setting and getting the value is potentially non-atomic – use
    [`Value()`](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Value "multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Value") instead to make sure that access is automatically synchronized
    using a lock.

    Note that an array of [`ctypes.c_char`](ctypes.html#ctypes.c_char "ctypes.c_char") has `value` and `raw`
    attributes which allow one to use it to store and retrieve strings – see
    documentation for [`ctypes`](ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python.").

multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Array(*typecode\_or\_type*, *size\_or\_initializer*, *\**, *lock=True*, *ctx=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Array "Link to this definition")
:   The same as [`RawArray()`](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawArray "multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawArray") except that depending on the value of *lock* a
    process-safe synchronization wrapper may be returned instead of a raw ctypes
    array.

    If *lock* is `True` (the default) then a new lock object is created to
    synchronize access to the value. If *lock* is a
    [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") or [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock") object
    then that will be used to synchronize access to the
    value. If *lock* is `False` then access to the returned object will not be
    automatically protected by a lock, so it will not necessarily be
    “process-safe”.

    *ctx* is a context object, or `None` (use the current context). If `None`,
    calling this may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    Note that *lock* and *ctx* are keyword-only parameters.

multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Value(*typecode\_or\_type*, *\*args*, *lock=True*, *ctx=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Value "Link to this definition")
:   The same as [`RawValue()`](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawValue "multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawValue") except that depending on the value of *lock* a
    process-safe synchronization wrapper may be returned instead of a raw ctypes
    object.

    If *lock* is `True` (the default) then a new lock object is created to
    synchronize access to the value. If *lock* is a [`Lock`](#multiprocessing.Lock "multiprocessing.Lock") or
    [`RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock") object then that will be used to synchronize access to the
    value. If *lock* is `False` then access to the returned object will not be
    automatically protected by a lock, so it will not necessarily be
    “process-safe”.

    *ctx* is a context object, or `None` (use the current context). If `None`,
    calling this may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    Note that *lock* and *ctx* are keyword-only parameters.

multiprocessing.sharedctypes.copy(*obj*)[¶](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.copy "Link to this definition")
:   Return a ctypes object allocated from shared memory which is a copy of the
    ctypes object *obj*.

multiprocessing.sharedctypes.synchronized(*obj*, *lock=None*, *ctx=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.sharedctypes.synchronized "Link to this definition")
:   Return a process-safe wrapper object for a ctypes object which uses *lock* to
    synchronize access. If *lock* is `None` (the default) then a
    [`multiprocessing.RLock`](#multiprocessing.RLock "multiprocessing.RLock") object is created automatically.

    *ctx* is a context object, or `None` (use the current context). If `None`,
    calling this may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    A synchronized wrapper will have two methods in addition to those of the
    object it wraps: `get_obj()` returns the wrapped object and
    `get_lock()` returns the lock object used for synchronization.

    Note that accessing the ctypes object through the wrapper can be a lot slower
    than accessing the raw ctypes object.

    Changed in version 3.5: Synchronized objects support the [context manager](../glossary.html#term-context-manager) protocol.

The table below compares the syntax for creating shared ctypes objects from
shared memory with the normal ctypes syntax. (In the table `MyStruct` is some
subclass of [`ctypes.Structure`](ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure "ctypes.Structure").)

| ctypes | sharedctypes using type | sharedctypes using typecode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c\_double(2.4) | RawValue(c\_double, 2.4) | RawValue(‘d’, 2.4) |
| MyStruct(4, 6) | RawValue(MyStruct, 4, 6) |  |
| (c\_short \* 7)() | RawArray(c\_short, 7) | RawArray(‘h’, 7) |
| (c\_int \* 3)(9, 2, 8) | RawArray(c\_int, (9, 2, 8)) | RawArray(‘i’, (9, 2, 8)) |

Below is an example where a number of ctypes objects are modified by a child
process:

```
from multiprocessing import Process, Lock
from multiprocessing.sharedctypes import Value, Array
from ctypes import Structure, c_double

class Point(Structure):
    _fields_ = [('x', c_double), ('y', c_double)]

def modify(n, x, s, A):
    n.value **= 2
    x.value **= 2
    s.value = s.value.upper()
    for a in A:
        a.x **= 2
        a.y **= 2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    lock = Lock()

    n = Value('i', 7)
    x = Value(c_double, 1.0/3.0, lock=False)
    s = Array('c', b'hello world', lock=lock)
    A = Array(Point, [(1.875,-6.25), (-5.75,2.0), (2.375,9.5)], lock=lock)

    p = Process(target=modify, args=(n, x, s, A))
    p.start()
    p.join()

    print(n.value)
    print(x.value)
    print(s.value)
    print([(a.x, a.y) for a in A])
```

The results printed are

```
49
0.1111111111111111
HELLO WORLD
[(3.515625, 39.0625), (33.0625, 4.0), (5.640625, 90.25)]
```

### Managers[¶](#managers "Link to this heading")

Managers provide a way to create data which can be shared between different
processes, including sharing over a network between processes running on
different machines. A manager object controls a server process which manages
*shared objects*. Other processes can access the shared objects by using
proxies.

multiprocessing.Manager()[¶](#multiprocessing.Manager "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a started [`SyncManager`](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager "multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager") object which
    can be used for sharing objects between processes. The returned manager
    object corresponds to a spawned child process and has methods which will
    create shared objects and return corresponding proxies.

Manager processes will be shutdown as soon as they are garbage collected or
their parent process exits. The manager classes are defined in the
[`multiprocessing.managers`](#module-multiprocessing.managers "multiprocessing.managers: Share data between process with shared objects.") module:

*class* multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager(*address=None*, *authkey=None*, *serializer='pickle'*, *ctx=None*, *\**, *shutdown\_timeout=1.0*)[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager "Link to this definition")
:   Create a BaseManager object.

    Once created one should call [`start()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.start "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.start") or `get_server().serve_forever()` to ensure
    that the manager object refers to a started manager process.

    *address* is the address on which the manager process listens for new
    connections. If *address* is `None` then an arbitrary one is chosen.

    *authkey* is the authentication key which will be used to check the
    validity of incoming connections to the server process. If
    *authkey* is `None` then `current_process().authkey` is used.
    Otherwise *authkey* is used and it must be a byte string.

    *serializer* must be `'pickle'` (use [`pickle`](pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.") serialization) or
    `'xmlrpclib'` (use [`xmlrpc.client`](xmlrpc.client.html#module-xmlrpc.client "xmlrpc.client: XML-RPC client access.") serialization).

    *ctx* is a context object, or `None` (use the current context). If `None`,
    calling this may set the global start method. See
    [Global start method](#global-start-method) for more details.

    *shutdown\_timeout* is a timeout in seconds used to wait until the process
    used by the manager completes in the [`shutdown()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.shutdown "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.shutdown") method. If the
    shutdown times out, the process is terminated. If terminating the process
    also times out, the process is killed.

    Changed in version 3.11: Added the *shutdown\_timeout* parameter.

    start([*initializer*[, *initargs*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.start "Link to this definition")
    :   Start a subprocess to start the manager. If *initializer* is not `None`
        then the subprocess will call `initializer(*initargs)` when it starts.

    get\_server()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.get_server "Link to this definition")
    :   Returns a `Server` object which represents the actual server under
        the control of the Manager. The `Server` object supports the
        `serve_forever()` method:

        ```
        >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
        >>> manager = BaseManager(address=('', 50000), authkey=b'abc')
        >>> server = manager.get_server()
        >>> server.serve_forever()
        ```

        `Server` additionally has an [`address`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.address "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.address") attribute.

    connect()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.connect "Link to this definition")
    :   Connect a local manager object to a remote manager process:

        ```
        >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
        >>> m = BaseManager(address=('127.0.0.1', 50000), authkey=b'abc')
        >>> m.connect()
        ```

    shutdown()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.shutdown "Link to this definition")
    :   Stop the process used by the manager. This is only available if
        [`start()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.start "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.start") has been used to start the server process.

        This can be called multiple times.

    register(*typeid*[, *callable*[, *proxytype*[, *exposed*[, *method\_to\_typeid*[, *create\_method*]]]]])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.register "Link to this definition")
    :   A classmethod which can be used for registering a type or callable with
        the manager class.

        *typeid* is a “type identifier” which is used to identify a particular
        type of shared object. This must be a string.

        *callable* is a callable used for creating objects for this type
        identifier. If a manager instance will be connected to the
        server using the [`connect()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.connect "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.connect") method, or if the
        *create\_method* argument is `False` then this can be left as
        `None`.

        *proxytype* is a subclass of [`BaseProxy`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy "multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy") which is used to create
        proxies for shared objects with this *typeid*. If `None` then a proxy
        class is created automatically.

        *exposed* is used to specify a sequence of method names which proxies for
        this typeid should be allowed to access using
        [`BaseProxy._callmethod()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod "multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod"). (If *exposed* is `None` then
        `proxytype._exposed_` is used instead if it exists.) In the case
        where no exposed list is specified, all “public methods” of the shared
        object will be accessible. (Here a “public method” means any attribute
        which has a [`__call__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__ "object.__call__") method and whose name does not begin
        with `'_'`.)

        *method\_to\_typeid* is a mapping used to specify the return type of those
        exposed methods which should return a proxy. It maps method names to
        typeid strings. (If *method\_to\_typeid* is `None` then
        `proxytype._method_to_typeid_` is used instead if it exists.) If a
        method’s name is not a key of this mapping or if the mapping is `None`
        then the object returned by the method will be copied by value.

        *create\_method* determines whether a method should be created with name
        *typeid* which can be used to tell the server process to create a new
        shared object and return a proxy for it. By default it is `True`.

    [`BaseManager`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager") instances also have one read-only property:

    address[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.address "Link to this definition")
    :   The address used by the manager.

    Changed in version 3.3: Manager objects support the context management protocol – see
    [Context Manager Types](stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager). [`__enter__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__enter__ "contextmanager.__enter__") starts the
    server process (if it has not already started) and then returns the
    manager object. [`__exit__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__exit__ "contextmanager.__exit__") calls [`shutdown()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.shutdown "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.shutdown").

    In previous versions [`__enter__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__enter__ "contextmanager.__enter__") did not start the
    manager’s server process if it was not already started.

*class* multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager "Link to this definition")
:   A subclass of [`BaseManager`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager") which can be used for the synchronization
    of processes. Objects of this type are returned by
    [`multiprocessing.Manager()`](#multiprocessing.Manager "multiprocessing.Manager").

    Its methods create and return [Proxy Objects](#multiprocessing-proxy-objects) for a
    number of commonly used data types to be synchronized across processes.
    This notably includes shared lists and dictionaries.

    Barrier(*parties*[, *action*[, *timeout*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Barrier "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`threading.Barrier`](threading.html#threading.Barrier "threading.Barrier") object and return a
        proxy for it.

        Added in version 3.3.

    BoundedSemaphore([*value*])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.BoundedSemaphore "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`threading.BoundedSemaphore`](threading.html#threading.BoundedSemaphore "threading.BoundedSemaphore") object and return a
        proxy for it.

    Condition([*lock*])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Condition "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`threading.Condition`](threading.html#threading.Condition "threading.Condition") object and return a proxy for
        it.

        If *lock* is supplied then it should be a proxy for a
        [`threading.Lock`](threading.html#threading.Lock "threading.Lock") or [`threading.RLock`](threading.html#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") object.

        Changed in version 3.3: The [`wait_for()`](threading.html#threading.Condition.wait_for "threading.Condition.wait_for") method was added.

    Event()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Event "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`threading.Event`](threading.html#threading.Event "threading.Event") object and return a proxy for it.

    Lock()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Lock "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`threading.Lock`](threading.html#threading.Lock "threading.Lock") object and return a proxy for it.

    Namespace()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Namespace "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`Namespace`](#multiprocessing.managers.Namespace "multiprocessing.managers.Namespace") object and return a proxy for it.

    Queue([*maxsize*])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Queue "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`queue.Queue`](queue.html#queue.Queue "queue.Queue") object and return a proxy for it.

    RLock()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.RLock "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`threading.RLock`](threading.html#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") object and return a proxy for it.

    Semaphore([*value*])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Semaphore "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a shared [`threading.Semaphore`](threading.html#threading.Semaphore "threading.Semaphore") object and return a proxy for
        it.

    Array(*typecode*, *sequence*)[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Array "Link to this definition")
    :   Create an array and return a proxy for it.

    Value(*typecode*, *value*)[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Value "Link to this definition")
    :   Create an object with a writable `value` attribute and return a proxy
        for it.

    dict()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.dict "Link to this definition")

    dict(*mapping*)

    dict(*sequence*)
    :   Create a shared [`dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict") object and return a proxy for it.

    list()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.list "Link to this definition")

    list(*sequence*)
    :   Create a shared [`list`](stdtypes.html#list "list") object and return a proxy for it.

    set()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.set "Link to this definition")

    set(*sequence*)

    set(*mapping*)
    :   Create a shared [`set`](stdtypes.html#set "set") object and return a proxy for it.

        Added in version 3.14: [`set`](stdtypes.html#set "set") support was added.

    Changed in version 3.6: Shared objects are capable of being nested. For example, a shared
    container object such as a shared list can contain other shared objects
    which will all be managed and synchronized by the [`SyncManager`](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager "multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager").

*class* multiprocessing.managers.Namespace[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.Namespace "Link to this definition")
:   A type that can register with [`SyncManager`](#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager "multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager").

    A namespace object has no public methods, but does have writable attributes.
    Its representation shows the values of its attributes.

    However, when using a proxy for a namespace object, an attribute beginning
    with `'_'` will be an attribute of the proxy and not an attribute of the
    referent:

    ```
    >>> mp_context = multiprocessing.get_context('spawn')
    >>> manager = mp_context.Manager()
    >>> Global = manager.Namespace()
    >>> Global.x = 10
    >>> Global.y = 'hello'
    >>> Global._z = 12.3    # this is an attribute of the proxy
    >>> print(Global)
    Namespace(x=10, y='hello')
    ```

#### Customized managers[¶](#customized-managers "Link to this heading")

To create one’s own manager, one creates a subclass of [`BaseManager`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager") and
uses the [`register()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.register "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.register") classmethod to register new types or
callables with the manager class. For example:

```
from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager

class MathsClass:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
    def mul(self, x, y):
        return x * y

class MyManager(BaseManager):
    pass

MyManager.register('Maths', MathsClass)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with MyManager() as manager:
        maths = manager.Maths()
        print(maths.add(4, 3))         # prints 7
        print(maths.mul(7, 8))         # prints 56
```

#### Using a remote manager[¶](#using-a-remote-manager "Link to this heading")

It is possible to run a manager server on one machine and have clients use it
from other machines (assuming that the firewalls involved allow it).

Running the following commands creates a server for a single shared queue which
remote clients can access:

```
>>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
>>> from queue import Queue
>>> queue = Queue()
>>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
>>> QueueManager.register('get_queue', callable=lambda:queue)
>>> m = QueueManager(address=('', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
>>> s = m.get_server()
>>> s.serve_forever()
```

One client can access the server as follows:

```
>>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
>>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
>>> QueueManager.register('get_queue')
>>> m = QueueManager(address=('foo.bar.org', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
>>> m.connect()
>>> queue = m.get_queue()
>>> queue.put('hello')
```

Another client can also use it:

```
>>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
>>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
>>> QueueManager.register('get_queue')
>>> m = QueueManager(address=('foo.bar.org', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
>>> m.connect()
>>> queue = m.get_queue()
>>> queue.get()
'hello'
```

Local processes can also access that queue, using the code from above on the
client to access it remotely:

```
>>> from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
>>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
>>> class Worker(Process):
...     def __init__(self, q):
...         self.q = q
...         super().__init__()
...     def run(self):
...         self.q.put('local hello')
...
>>> queue = Queue()
>>> w = Worker(queue)
>>> w.start()
>>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
...
>>> QueueManager.register('get_queue', callable=lambda: queue)
>>> m = QueueManager(address=('', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
>>> s = m.get_server()
>>> s.serve_forever()
```

### Proxy Objects[¶](#proxy-objects "Link to this heading")

A proxy is an object which *refers* to a shared object which lives (presumably)
in a different process. The shared object is said to be the *referent* of the
proxy. Multiple proxy objects may have the same referent.

A proxy object has methods which invoke corresponding methods of its referent
(although not every method of the referent will necessarily be available through
the proxy). In this way, a proxy can be used just like its referent can:

```
>>> mp_context = multiprocessing.get_context('spawn')
>>> manager = mp_context.Manager()
>>> l = manager.list([i*i for i in range(10)])
>>> print(l)
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
>>> print(repr(l))
<ListProxy object, typeid 'list' at 0x...>
>>> l[4]
16
>>> l[2:5]
[4, 9, 16]
```

Notice that applying [`str()`](stdtypes.html#str "str") to a proxy will return the representation of
the referent, whereas applying [`repr()`](functions.html#repr "repr") will return the representation of
the proxy.

An important feature of proxy objects is that they are picklable so they can be
passed between processes. As such, a referent can contain
[Proxy Objects](#multiprocessing-proxy-objects). This permits nesting of these managed
lists, dicts, and other [Proxy Objects](#multiprocessing-proxy-objects):

```
>>> a = manager.list()
>>> b = manager.list()
>>> a.append(b)         # referent of a now contains referent of b
>>> print(a, b)
[<ListProxy object, typeid 'list' at ...>] []
>>> b.append('hello')
>>> print(a[0], b)
['hello'] ['hello']
```

Similarly, dict and list proxies may be nested inside one another:

```
>>> l_outer = manager.list([ manager.dict() for i in range(2) ])
>>> d_first_inner = l_outer[0]
>>> d_first_inner['a'] = 1
>>> d_first_inner['b'] = 2
>>> l_outer[1]['c'] = 3
>>> l_outer[1]['z'] = 26
>>> print(l_outer[0])
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> print(l_outer[1])
{'c': 3, 'z': 26}
```

If standard (non-proxy) [`list`](stdtypes.html#list "list") or [`dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict") objects are contained
in a referent, modifications to those mutable values will not be propagated
through the manager because the proxy has no way of knowing when the values
contained within are modified. However, storing a value in a container proxy
(which triggers a `__setitem__` on the proxy object) does propagate through
the manager and so to effectively modify such an item, one could re-assign the
modified value to the container proxy:

```
# create a list proxy and append a mutable object (a dictionary)
lproxy = manager.list()
lproxy.append({})
# now mutate the dictionary
d = lproxy[0]
d['a'] = 1
d['b'] = 2
# at this point, the changes to d are not yet synced, but by
# updating the dictionary, the proxy is notified of the change
lproxy[0] = d
```

This approach is perhaps less convenient than employing nested
[Proxy Objects](#multiprocessing-proxy-objects) for most use cases but also
demonstrates a level of control over the synchronization.

Note

The proxy types in `multiprocessing` do nothing to support comparisons
by value. So, for instance, we have:

```
>>> manager.list([1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]
False
```

One should just use a copy of the referent instead when making comparisons.

*class* multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy "Link to this definition")
:   Proxy objects are instances of subclasses of [`BaseProxy`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy "multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy").

    \_callmethod(*methodname*[, *args*[, *kwds*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod "Link to this definition")
    :   Call and return the result of a method of the proxy’s referent.

        If `proxy` is a proxy whose referent is `obj` then the expression

        ```
        proxy._callmethod(methodname, args, kwds)
        ```

        will evaluate the expression

        ```
        getattr(obj, methodname)(*args, **kwds)
        ```

        in the manager’s process.

        The returned value will be a copy of the result of the call or a proxy to
        a new shared object – see documentation for the *method\_to\_typeid*
        argument of [`BaseManager.register()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.register "multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.register").

        If an exception is raised by the call, then is re-raised by
        [`_callmethod()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod "multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod"). If some other exception is raised in the manager’s
        process then this is converted into a `RemoteError` exception and is
        raised by [`_callmethod()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod "multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod").

        Note in particular that an exception will be raised if *methodname* has
        not been *exposed*.

        An example of the usage of [`_callmethod()`](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod "multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._callmethod"):

        ```
        >>> l = manager.list(range(10))
        >>> l._callmethod('__len__')
        10
        >>> l._callmethod('__getitem__', (slice(2, 7),)) # equivalent to l[2:7]
        [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        >>> l._callmethod('__getitem__', (20,))          # equivalent to l[20]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        IndexError: list index out of range
        ```

    \_getvalue()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy._getvalue "Link to this definition")
    :   Return a copy of the referent.

        If the referent is unpicklable then this will raise an exception.

    \_\_repr\_\_()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy.__repr__ "Link to this definition")
    :   Return a representation of the proxy object.

    \_\_str\_\_()[¶](#multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy.__str__ "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the representation of the referent.

#### Cleanup[¶](#cleanup "Link to this heading")

A proxy object uses a weakref callback so that when it gets garbage collected it
deregisters itself from the manager which owns its referent.

A shared object gets deleted from the manager process when there are no longer
any proxies referring to it.

### Process Pools[¶](#module-multiprocessing.pool "Link to this heading")

One can create a pool of processes which will carry out tasks submitted to it
with the [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") class.

*class* multiprocessing.pool.Pool([*processes*[, *initializer*[, *initargs*[, *maxtasksperchild*[, *context*]]]]])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "Link to this definition")
:   A process pool object which controls a pool of worker processes to which jobs
    can be submitted. It supports asynchronous results with timeouts and
    callbacks and has a parallel map implementation.

    *processes* is the number of worker processes to use. If *processes* is
    `None` then the number returned by [`os.process_cpu_count()`](os.html#os.process_cpu_count "os.process_cpu_count") is used.

    If *initializer* is not `None` then each worker process will call
    `initializer(*initargs)` when it starts.

    *maxtasksperchild* is the number of tasks a worker process can complete
    before it will exit and be replaced with a fresh worker process, to enable
    unused resources to be freed. The default *maxtasksperchild* is `None`, which
    means worker processes will live as long as the pool.

    *context* can be used to specify the context used for starting
    the worker processes. Usually a pool is created using the
    function `multiprocessing.Pool()` or the [`Pool()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") method
    of a context object. In both cases *context* is set
    appropriately. If `None`, calling this function will have the side effect
    of setting the current global start method if it has not been set already.
    See the `get_context()` function.

    Note that the methods of the pool object should only be called by
    the process which created the pool.

    Warning

    [`multiprocessing.pool`](#module-multiprocessing.pool "multiprocessing.pool: Create pools of processes.") objects have internal resources that need to be
    properly managed (like any other resource) by using the pool as a context manager
    or by calling [`close()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.close "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.close") and [`terminate()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate") manually. Failure to do this
    can lead to the process hanging on finalization.

    Note that it is **not correct** to rely on the garbage collector to destroy the pool
    as CPython does not assure that the finalizer of the pool will be called
    (see [`object.__del__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__") for more information).

    Changed in version 3.2: Added the *maxtasksperchild* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.4: Added the *context* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.13: *processes* uses [`os.process_cpu_count()`](os.html#os.process_cpu_count "os.process_cpu_count") by default, instead of
    [`os.cpu_count()`](os.html#os.cpu_count "os.cpu_count").

    Note

    Worker processes within a [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") typically live for the complete
    duration of the Pool’s work queue. A frequent pattern found in other
    systems (such as Apache, mod\_wsgi, etc) to free resources held by
    workers is to allow a worker within a pool to complete only a set
    amount of work before exiting, being cleaned up and a new
    process spawned to replace the old one. The *maxtasksperchild*
    argument to the [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") exposes this ability to the end user.

    apply(*func*[, *args*[, *kwds*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply "Link to this definition")
    :   Call *func* with arguments *args* and keyword arguments *kwds*. It blocks
        until the result is ready. Given this blocks, [`apply_async()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async") is
        better suited for performing work in parallel. Additionally, *func*
        is only executed in one of the workers of the pool.

    apply\_async(*func*[, *args*[, *kwds*[, *callback*[, *error\_callback*]]]])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async "Link to this definition")
    :   A variant of the [`apply()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply") method which returns a
        [`AsyncResult`](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult "multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult") object.

        If *callback* is specified then it should be a callable which accepts a
        single argument. When the result becomes ready *callback* is applied to
        it, that is unless the call failed, in which case the *error\_callback*
        is applied instead.

        If *error\_callback* is specified then it should be a callable which
        accepts a single argument. If the target function fails, then
        the *error\_callback* is called with the exception instance.

        Callbacks should complete immediately since otherwise the thread which
        handles the results will get blocked.

    map(*func*, *iterable*[, *chunksize*])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map "Link to this definition")
    :   A parallel equivalent of the [`map()`](functions.html#map "map") built-in function (it supports only
        one *iterable* argument though, for multiple iterables see [`starmap()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap")).
        It blocks until the result is ready.

        This method chops the iterable into a number of chunks which it submits to
        the process pool as separate tasks. The (approximate) size of these
        chunks can be specified by setting *chunksize* to a positive integer.

        Note that it may cause high memory usage for very long iterables. Consider
        using [`imap()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap") or [`imap_unordered()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap_unordered "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap_unordered") with explicit *chunksize*
        option for better efficiency.

    map\_async(*func*, *iterable*[, *chunksize*[, *callback*[, *error\_callback*]]])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map_async "Link to this definition")
    :   A variant of the [`map()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map") method which returns a
        [`AsyncResult`](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult "multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult") object.

        If *callback* is specified then it should be a callable which accepts a
        single argument. When the result becomes ready *callback* is applied to
        it, that is unless the call failed, in which case the *error\_callback*
        is applied instead.

        If *error\_callback* is specified then it should be a callable which
        accepts a single argument. If the target function fails, then
        the *error\_callback* is called with the exception instance.

        Callbacks should complete immediately since otherwise the thread which
        handles the results will get blocked.

    imap(*func*, *iterable*[, *chunksize*])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap "Link to this definition")
    :   A lazier version of [`map()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map").

        The *chunksize* argument is the same as the one used by the [`map()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map")
        method. For very long iterables using a large value for *chunksize* can
        make the job complete **much** faster than using the default value of
        `1`.

        Also if *chunksize* is `1` then the `next()` method of the iterator
        returned by the [`imap()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap") method has an optional *timeout* parameter:
        `next(timeout)` will raise [`multiprocessing.TimeoutError`](#multiprocessing.TimeoutError "multiprocessing.TimeoutError") if the
        result cannot be returned within *timeout* seconds.

    imap\_unordered(*func*, *iterable*[, *chunksize*])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap_unordered "Link to this definition")
    :   The same as [`imap()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap") except that the ordering of the results from the
        returned iterator should be considered arbitrary. (Only when there is
        only one worker process is the order guaranteed to be “correct”.)

    starmap(*func*, *iterable*[, *chunksize*])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap "Link to this definition")
    :   Like [`map()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map") except that the
        elements of the *iterable* are expected to be iterables that are
        unpacked as arguments.

        Hence an *iterable* of `[(1,2), (3, 4)]` results in `[func(1,2),
        func(3,4)]`.

        Added in version 3.3.

    starmap\_async(*func*, *iterable*[, *chunksize*[, *callback*[, *error\_callback*]]])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap_async "Link to this definition")
    :   A combination of [`starmap()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap") and [`map_async()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map_async "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map_async") that iterates over
        *iterable* of iterables and calls *func* with the iterables unpacked.
        Returns a result object.

        Added in version 3.3.

    close()[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.close "Link to this definition")
    :   Prevents any more tasks from being submitted to the pool. Once all the
        tasks have been completed the worker processes will exit.

    terminate()[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate "Link to this definition")
    :   Stops the worker processes immediately without completing outstanding
        work. When the pool object is garbage collected [`terminate()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate") will be
        called immediately.

    join()[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.join "Link to this definition")
    :   Wait for the worker processes to exit. One must call [`close()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.close "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.close") or
        [`terminate()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate") before using [`join()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.join "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.join").

    Changed in version 3.3: Pool objects now support the context management protocol – see
    [Context Manager Types](stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager). [`__enter__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__enter__ "contextmanager.__enter__") returns the
    pool object, and [`__exit__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__exit__ "contextmanager.__exit__") calls [`terminate()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate").

*class* multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult "Link to this definition")
:   The class of the result returned by [`Pool.apply_async()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async") and
    [`Pool.map_async()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map_async "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.map_async").

    get([*timeout*])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult.get "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the result when it arrives. If *timeout* is not `None` and the
        result does not arrive within *timeout* seconds then
        [`multiprocessing.TimeoutError`](#multiprocessing.TimeoutError "multiprocessing.TimeoutError") is raised. If the remote call raised
        an exception then that exception will be reraised by [`get()`](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult.get "multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult.get").

    wait([*timeout*])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult.wait "Link to this definition")
    :   Wait until the result is available or until *timeout* seconds pass.

    ready()[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult.ready "Link to this definition")
    :   Return whether the call has completed.

    successful()[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult.successful "Link to this definition")
    :   Return whether the call completed without raising an exception. Will
        raise [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the result is not ready.

        Changed in version 3.7: If the result is not ready, [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised instead of
        [`AssertionError`](exceptions.html#AssertionError "AssertionError").

The following example demonstrates the use of a pool:

```
from multiprocessing import Pool
import time

def f(x):
    return x*x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Pool(processes=4) as pool:         # start 4 worker processes
        result = pool.apply_async(f, (10,)) # evaluate "f(10)" asynchronously in a single process
        print(result.get(timeout=1))        # prints "100" unless your computer is *very* slow

        print(pool.map(f, range(10)))       # prints "[0, 1, 4,..., 81]"

        it = pool.imap(f, range(10))
        print(next(it))                     # prints "0"
        print(next(it))                     # prints "1"
        print(it.next(timeout=1))           # prints "4" unless your computer is *very* slow

        result = pool.apply_async(time.sleep, (10,))
        print(result.get(timeout=1))        # raises multiprocessing.TimeoutError
```

### Listeners and Clients[¶](#module-multiprocessing.connection "Link to this heading")

Usually message passing between processes is done using queues or by using
[`Connection`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection "multiprocessing.connection.Connection") objects returned by
[`Pipe()`](#multiprocessing.Pipe "multiprocessing.Pipe").

However, the `multiprocessing.connection` module allows some extra
flexibility. It basically gives a high level message oriented API for dealing
with sockets or Windows named pipes. It also has support for *digest
authentication* using the [`hmac`](hmac.html#module-hmac "hmac: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication (HMAC) implementation") module, and for polling
multiple connections at the same time.

multiprocessing.connection.deliver\_challenge(*connection*, *authkey*)[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.deliver_challenge "Link to this definition")
:   Send a randomly generated message to the other end of the connection and wait
    for a reply.

    If the reply matches the digest of the message using *authkey* as the key
    then a welcome message is sent to the other end of the connection. Otherwise
    [`AuthenticationError`](#multiprocessing.AuthenticationError "multiprocessing.AuthenticationError") is raised.

multiprocessing.connection.answer\_challenge(*connection*, *authkey*)[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.answer_challenge "Link to this definition")
:   Receive a message, calculate the digest of the message using *authkey* as the
    key, and then send the digest back.

    If a welcome message is not received, then
    [`AuthenticationError`](#multiprocessing.AuthenticationError "multiprocessing.AuthenticationError") is raised.

multiprocessing.connection.Client(*address*[, *family*[, *authkey*]])[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Client "Link to this definition")
:   Attempt to set up a connection to the listener which is using address
    *address*, returning a [`Connection`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection "multiprocessing.connection.Connection").

    The type of the connection is determined by *family* argument, but this can
    generally be omitted since it can usually be inferred from the format of
    *address*. (See [Address Formats](#multiprocessing-address-formats))

    If *authkey* is given and not `None`, it should be a byte string and will be
    used as the secret key for an HMAC-based authentication challenge. No
    authentication is done if *authkey* is `None`.
    [`AuthenticationError`](#multiprocessing.AuthenticationError "multiprocessing.AuthenticationError") is raised if authentication fails.
    See [Authentication keys](#multiprocessing-auth-keys).

*class* multiprocessing.connection.Listener([*address*[, *family*[, *backlog*[, *authkey*]]]])[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Listener "Link to this definition")
:   A wrapper for a bound socket or Windows named pipe which is ‘listening’ for
    connections.

    *address* is the address to be used by the bound socket or named pipe of the
    listener object.

    Note

    If an address of ‘0.0.0.0’ is used, the address will not be a connectable
    end point on Windows. If you require a connectable end-point,
    you should use ‘127.0.0.1’.

    *family* is the type of socket (or named pipe) to use. This can be one of
    the strings `'AF_INET'` (for a TCP socket), `'AF_UNIX'` (for a Unix
    domain socket) or `'AF_PIPE'` (for a Windows named pipe). Of these only
    the first is guaranteed to be available. If *family* is `None` then the
    family is inferred from the format of *address*. If *address* is also
    `None` then a default is chosen. This default is the family which is
    assumed to be the fastest available. See
    [Address Formats](#multiprocessing-address-formats). Note that if *family* is
    `'AF_UNIX'` and address is `None` then the socket will be created in a
    private temporary directory created using [`tempfile.mkstemp()`](tempfile.html#tempfile.mkstemp "tempfile.mkstemp").

    If the listener object uses a socket then *backlog* (1 by default) is passed
    to the [`listen()`](socket.html#socket.socket.listen "socket.socket.listen") method of the socket once it has been
    bound.

    If *authkey* is given and not `None`, it should be a byte string and will be
    used as the secret key for an HMAC-based authentication challenge. No
    authentication is done if *authkey* is `None`.
    [`AuthenticationError`](#multiprocessing.AuthenticationError "multiprocessing.AuthenticationError") is raised if authentication fails.
    See [Authentication keys](#multiprocessing-auth-keys).

    accept()[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Listener.accept "Link to this definition")
    :   Accept a connection on the bound socket or named pipe of the listener
        object and return a [`Connection`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection "multiprocessing.connection.Connection") object.
        If authentication is attempted and fails, then
        [`AuthenticationError`](#multiprocessing.AuthenticationError "multiprocessing.AuthenticationError") is raised.

    close()[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Listener.close "Link to this definition")
    :   Close the bound socket or named pipe of the listener object. This is
        called automatically when the listener is garbage collected. However it
        is advisable to call it explicitly.

    Listener objects have the following read-only properties:

    address[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Listener.address "Link to this definition")
    :   The address which is being used by the Listener object.

    last\_accepted[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.Listener.last_accepted "Link to this definition")
    :   The address from which the last accepted connection came. If this is
        unavailable then it is `None`.

    Changed in version 3.3: Listener objects now support the context management protocol – see
    [Context Manager Types](stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager). [`__enter__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__enter__ "contextmanager.__enter__") returns the
    listener object, and [`__exit__()`](stdtypes.html#contextmanager.__exit__ "contextmanager.__exit__") calls [`close()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Listener.close "multiprocessing.connection.Listener.close").

multiprocessing.connection.wait(*object\_list*, *timeout=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.connection.wait "Link to this definition")
:   Wait till an object in *object\_list* is ready. Returns the list of
    those objects in *object\_list* which are ready. If *timeout* is a
    float then the call blocks for at most that many seconds. If
    *timeout* is `None` then it will block for an unlimited period.
    A negative timeout is equivalent to a zero timeout.

    For both POSIX and Windows, an object can appear in *object\_list* if
    it is

    * a readable [`Connection`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection "multiprocessing.connection.Connection") object;
    * a connected and readable [`socket.socket`](socket.html#socket.socket "socket.socket") object; or
    * the [`sentinel`](#multiprocessing.Process.sentinel "multiprocessing.Process.sentinel") attribute of a
      [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") object.

    A connection or socket object is ready when there is data available
    to be read from it, or the other end has been closed.

    **POSIX**: `wait(object_list, timeout)` almost equivalent
    `select.select(object_list, [], [], timeout)`. The difference is
    that, if [`select.select()`](select.html#select.select "select.select") is interrupted by a signal, it can
    raise [`OSError`](exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") with an error number of `EINTR`, whereas
    [`wait()`](#multiprocessing.connection.wait "multiprocessing.connection.wait") will not.

    **Windows**: An item in *object\_list* must either be an integer
    handle which is waitable (according to the definition used by the
    documentation of the Win32 function `WaitForMultipleObjects()`)
    or it can be an object with a [`fileno()`](io.html#io.IOBase.fileno "io.IOBase.fileno") method which returns a
    socket handle or pipe handle. (Note that pipe handles and socket
    handles are **not** waitable handles.)

    Added in version 3.3.

**Examples**

The following server code creates a listener which uses `'secret password'` as
an authentication key. It then waits for a connection and sends some data to
the client:

```
from multiprocessing.connection import Listener
from array import array

address = ('localhost', 6000)     # family is deduced to be 'AF_INET'

with Listener(address, authkey=b'secret password') as listener:
    with listener.accept() as conn:
        print('connection accepted from', listener.last_accepted)

        conn.send([2.25, None, 'junk', float])

        conn.send_bytes(b'hello')

        conn.send_bytes(array('i', [42, 1729]))
```

The following code connects to the server and receives some data from the
server:

```
from multiprocessing.connection import Client
from array import array

address = ('localhost', 6000)

with Client(address, authkey=b'secret password') as conn:
    print(conn.recv())                  # => [2.25, None, 'junk', float]

    print(conn.recv_bytes())            # => 'hello'

    arr = array('i', [0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    print(conn.recv_bytes_into(arr))    # => 8
    print(arr)                          # => array('i', [42, 1729, 0, 0, 0])
```

The following code uses [`wait()`](#multiprocessing.connection.wait "multiprocessing.connection.wait") to
wait for messages from multiple processes at once:

```
from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe, current_process
from multiprocessing.connection import wait

def foo(w):
    for i in range(10):
        w.send((i, current_process().name))
    w.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    readers = []

    for i in range(4):
        r, w = Pipe(duplex=False)
        readers.append(r)
        p = Process(target=foo, args=(w,))
        p.start()
        # We close the writable end of the pipe now to be sure that
        # p is the only process which owns a handle for it.  This
        # ensures that when p closes its handle for the writable end,
        # wait() will promptly report the readable end as being ready.
        w.close()

    while readers:
        for r in wait(readers):
            try:
                msg = r.recv()
            except EOFError:
                readers.remove(r)
            else:
                print(msg)
```

#### Address Formats[¶](#address-formats "Link to this heading")

* An `'AF_INET'` address is a tuple of the form `(hostname, port)` where
  *hostname* is a string and *port* is an integer.
* An `'AF_UNIX'` address is a string representing a filename on the
  filesystem.
* An `'AF_PIPE'` address is a string of the form
  `r'\\.\pipe\PipeName'`. To use [`Client()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Client "multiprocessing.connection.Client") to connect to a named
  pipe on a remote computer called *ServerName* one should use an address of the
  form `r'\\ServerName\pipe\PipeName'` instead.

Note that any string beginning with two backslashes is assumed by default to be
an `'AF_PIPE'` address rather than an `'AF_UNIX'` address.

### Authentication keys[¶](#authentication-keys "Link to this heading")

When one uses [`Connection.recv`](#multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv "multiprocessing.connection.Connection.recv"), the
data received is automatically
unpickled. Unfortunately unpickling data from an untrusted source is a security
risk. Therefore [`Listener`](#multiprocessing.connection.Listener "multiprocessing.connection.Listener") and [`Client()`](#multiprocessing.connection.Client "multiprocessing.connection.Client") use the [`hmac`](hmac.html#module-hmac "hmac: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication (HMAC) implementation") module
to provide digest authentication.

An authentication key is a byte string which can be thought of as a
password: once a connection is established both ends will demand proof
that the other knows the authentication key. (Demonstrating that both
ends are using the same key does **not** involve sending the key over
the connection.)

If authentication is requested but no authentication key is specified then the
return value of `current_process().authkey` is used (see
[`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process")). This value will be automatically inherited by
any [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") object that the current process creates.
This means that (by default) all processes of a multi-process program will share
a single authentication key which can be used when setting up connections
between themselves.

Suitable authentication keys can also be generated by using [`os.urandom()`](os.html#os.urandom "os.urandom").

### Logging[¶](#logging "Link to this heading")

Some support for logging is available. Note, however, that the [`logging`](logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.")
package does not use process shared locks so it is possible (depending on the
handler type) for messages from different processes to get mixed up.

multiprocessing.get\_logger()[¶](#multiprocessing.get_logger "Link to this definition")
:   Returns the logger used by `multiprocessing`. If necessary, a new one
    will be created.

    When first created the logger has level [`logging.NOTSET`](logging.html#logging.NOTSET "logging.NOTSET") and no
    default handler. Messages sent to this logger will not by default propagate
    to the root logger.

    Note that on Windows child processes will only inherit the level of the
    parent process’s logger – any other customization of the logger will not be
    inherited.

multiprocessing.log\_to\_stderr(*level=None*)[¶](#multiprocessing.log_to_stderr "Link to this definition")
:   This function performs a call to [`get_logger()`](#multiprocessing.get_logger "multiprocessing.get_logger") but in addition to
    returning the logger created by get\_logger, it adds a handler which sends
    output to [`sys.stderr`](sys.html#sys.stderr "sys.stderr") using format
    `'[%(levelname)s/%(processName)s] %(message)s'`.
    You can modify `levelname` of the logger by passing a `level` argument.

Below is an example session with logging turned on:

```
>>> import multiprocessing, logging
>>> logger = multiprocessing.log_to_stderr()
>>> logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
>>> logger.warning('doomed')
[WARNING/MainProcess] doomed
>>> m = multiprocessing.Manager()
[INFO/SyncManager-...] child process calling self.run()
[INFO/SyncManager-...] created temp directory /.../pymp-...
[INFO/SyncManager-...] manager serving at '/.../listener-...'
>>> del m
[INFO/MainProcess] sending shutdown message to manager
[INFO/SyncManager-...] manager exiting with exitcode 0
```

For a full table of logging levels, see the [`logging`](logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.") module.

### The `multiprocessing.dummy` module[¶](#module-multiprocessing.dummy "Link to this heading")

`multiprocessing.dummy` replicates the API of `multiprocessing` but is
no more than a wrapper around the [`threading`](threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.") module.

In particular, the `Pool` function provided by `multiprocessing.dummy`
returns an instance of [`ThreadPool`](#multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool "multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool"), which is a subclass of
[`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") that supports all the same method calls but uses a pool of
worker threads rather than worker processes.

*class* multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool([*processes*[, *initializer*[, *initargs*]]])[¶](#multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool "Link to this definition")
:   A thread pool object which controls a pool of worker threads to which jobs
    can be submitted. [`ThreadPool`](#multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool "multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool") instances are fully interface
    compatible with [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool") instances, and their resources must also be
    properly managed, either by using the pool as a context manager or by
    calling [`close()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.close "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.close") and
    [`terminate()`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate "multiprocessing.pool.Pool.terminate") manually.

    *processes* is the number of worker threads to use. If *processes* is
    `None` then the number returned by [`os.process_cpu_count()`](os.html#os.process_cpu_count "os.process_cpu_count") is used.

    If *initializer* is not `None` then each worker process will call
    `initializer(*initargs)` when it starts.

    Unlike [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool"), *maxtasksperchild* and *context* cannot be provided.

    Note

    A [`ThreadPool`](#multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool "multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool") shares the same interface as [`Pool`](#multiprocessing.pool.Pool "multiprocessing.pool.Pool"), which
    is designed around a pool of processes and predates the introduction of
    the [`concurrent.futures`](concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures "concurrent.futures: Execute computations concurrently using threads or processes.") module. As such, it inherits some
    operations that don’t make sense for a pool backed by threads, and it
    has its own type for representing the status of asynchronous jobs,
    [`AsyncResult`](#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult "multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult"), that is not understood by any other libraries.

    Users should generally prefer to use
    [`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor"), which has a simpler
    interface that was designed around threads from the start, and which
    returns [`concurrent.futures.Future`](concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Future "concurrent.futures.Future") instances that are
    compatible with many other libraries, including [`asyncio`](asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.").

## Programming guidelines[¶](#programming-guidelines "Link to this heading")

There are certain guidelines and idioms which should be adhered to when using
`multiprocessing`.

### All start methods[¶](#all-start-methods "Link to this heading")

The following applies to all start methods.

Avoid shared state

> As far as possible one should try to avoid shifting large amounts of data
> between processes.
>
> It is probably best to stick to using queues or pipes for communication
> between processes rather than using the lower level synchronization
> primitives.

Picklability

> Ensure that the arguments to the methods of proxies are picklable.

Thread safety of proxies

> Do not use a proxy object from more than one thread unless you protect it
> with a lock.
>
> (There is never a problem with different processes using the *same* proxy.)

Joining zombie processes

> On POSIX when a process finishes but has not been joined it becomes a zombie.
> There should never be very many because each time a new process starts (or
> [`active_children()`](#multiprocessing.active_children "multiprocessing.active_children") is called) all completed processes
> which have not yet been joined will be joined. Also calling a finished
> process’s [`Process.is_alive`](#multiprocessing.Process.is_alive "multiprocessing.Process.is_alive") will
> join the process. Even so it is probably good
> practice to explicitly join all the processes that you start.

Better to inherit than pickle/unpickle

> When using the *spawn* or *forkserver* start methods many types
> from `multiprocessing` need to be picklable so that child
> processes can use them. However, one should generally avoid
> sending shared objects to other processes using pipes or queues.
> Instead you should arrange the program so that a process which
> needs access to a shared resource created elsewhere can inherit it
> from an ancestor process.

Avoid terminating processes

> Using the [`Process.terminate`](#multiprocessing.Process.terminate "multiprocessing.Process.terminate")
> method to stop a process is liable to
> cause any shared resources (such as locks, semaphores, pipes and queues)
> currently being used by the process to become broken or unavailable to other
> processes.
>
> Therefore it is probably best to only consider using
> [`Process.terminate`](#multiprocessing.Process.terminate "multiprocessing.Process.terminate") on processes
> which never use any shared resources.

Joining processes that use queues

> Bear in mind that a process that has put items in a queue will wait before
> terminating until all the buffered items are fed by the “feeder” thread to
> the underlying pipe. (The child process can call the
> [`Queue.cancel_join_thread`](#multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread "multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread")
> method of the queue to avoid this behaviour.)
>
> This means that whenever you use a queue you need to make sure that all
> items which have been put on the queue will eventually be removed before the
> process is joined. Otherwise you cannot be sure that processes which have
> put items on the queue will terminate. Remember also that non-daemonic
> processes will be joined automatically.
>
> An example which will deadlock is the following:
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
>
> def f(q):
>     q.put('X' * 1000000)
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     queue = Queue()
>     p = Process(target=f, args=(queue,))
>     p.start()
>     p.join()                    # this deadlocks
>     obj = queue.get()
> ```
>
> A fix here would be to swap the last two lines (or simply remove the
> `p.join()` line).

Explicitly pass resources to child processes

> On POSIX using the *fork* start method, a child process can make
> use of a shared resource created in a parent process using a
> global resource. However, it is better to pass the object as an
> argument to the constructor for the child process.
>
> Apart from making the code (potentially) compatible with Windows
> and the other start methods this also ensures that as long as the
> child process is still alive the object will not be garbage
> collected in the parent process. This might be important if some
> resource is freed when the object is garbage collected in the
> parent process.
>
> So for instance
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, Lock
>
> def f():
>     ... do something using "lock" ...
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     lock = Lock()
>     for i in range(10):
>         Process(target=f).start()
> ```
>
> should be rewritten as
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, Lock
>
> def f(l):
>     ... do something using "l" ...
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     lock = Lock()
>     for i in range(10):
>         Process(target=f, args=(lock,)).start()
> ```

Beware of replacing [`sys.stdin`](sys.html#sys.stdin "sys.stdin") with a “file like object”

> `multiprocessing` originally unconditionally called:
>
> ```
> os.close(sys.stdin.fileno())
> ```
>
> in the `multiprocessing.Process._bootstrap()` method — this resulted
> in issues with processes-in-processes. This has been changed to:
>
> ```
> sys.stdin.close()
> sys.stdin = open(os.open(os.devnull, os.O_RDONLY), closefd=False)
> ```
>
> Which solves the fundamental issue of processes colliding with each other
> resulting in a bad file descriptor error, but introduces a potential danger
> to applications which replace [`sys.stdin()`](sys.html#sys.stdin "sys.stdin") with a “file-like object”
> with output buffering. This danger is that if multiple processes call
> [`close()`](io.html#io.IOBase.close "io.IOBase.close") on this file-like object, it could result in the same
> data being flushed to the object multiple times, resulting in corruption.
>
> If you write a file-like object and implement your own caching, you can
> make it fork-safe by storing the pid whenever you append to the cache,
> and discarding the cache when the pid changes. For example:
>
> ```
> @property
> def cache(self):
>     pid = os.getpid()
>     if pid != self._pid:
>         self._pid = pid
>         self._cache = []
>     return self._cache
> ```
>
> For more information, see [bpo-5155](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=5155), [bpo-5313](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=5313) and [bpo-5331](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=5331)

### The *spawn* and *forkserver* start methods[¶](#the-spawn-and-forkserver-start-methods "Link to this heading")

There are a few extra restrictions which don’t apply to the *fork*
start method.

More picklability

> Ensure that all arguments to [`Process`](#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") are
> picklable. Also, if you subclass `Process.__init__`, you must make sure
> that instances will be picklable when the
> [`Process.start`](#multiprocessing.Process.start "multiprocessing.Process.start") method is called.

Global variables

> Bear in mind that if code run in a child process tries to access a global
> variable, then the value it sees (if any) may not be the same as the value
> in the parent process at the time that [`Process.start`](#multiprocessing.Process.start "multiprocessing.Process.start") was called.
>
> However, global variables which are just module level constants cause no
> problems.

Safe importing of main module

> Make sure that the main module can be safely imported by a new Python
> interpreter without causing unintended side effects (such as starting a new
> process).
>
> For example, using the *spawn* or *forkserver* start method
> running the following module would fail with a
> [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"):
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process
>
> def foo():
>     print('hello')
>
> p = Process(target=foo)
> p.start()
> ```
>
> Instead one should protect the “entry point” of the program by using `if
> __name__ == '__main__':` as follows:
>
> ```
> from multiprocessing import Process, freeze_support, set_start_method
>
> def foo():
>     print('hello')
>
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>     freeze_support()
>     set_start_method('spawn')
>     p = Process(target=foo)
>     p.start()
> ```
>
> (The `freeze_support()` line can be omitted if the program will be run
> normally instead of frozen.)
>
> This allows the newly spawned Python interpreter to safely import the module
> and then run the module’s `foo()` function.
>
> Similar restrictions apply if a pool or manager is created in the main
> module.

## Examples[¶](#examples "Link to this heading")

Demonstration of how to create and use customized managers and proxies:

```
from multiprocessing import freeze_support
from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager, BaseProxy
import operator

##

class Foo:
    def f(self):
        print('you called Foo.f()')
    def g(self):
        print('you called Foo.g()')
    def _h(self):
        print('you called Foo._h()')

# A simple generator function
def baz():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i*i

# Proxy type for generator objects
class GeneratorProxy(BaseProxy):
    _exposed_ = ['__next__']
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    def __next__(self):
        return self._callmethod('__next__')

# Function to return the operator module
def get_operator_module():
    return operator

##

class MyManager(BaseManager):
    pass

# register the Foo class; make `f()` and `g()` accessible via proxy
MyManager.register('Foo1', Foo)

# register the Foo class; make `g()` and `_h()` accessible via proxy
MyManager.register('Foo2', Foo, exposed=('g', '_h'))

# register the generator function baz; use `GeneratorProxy` to make proxies
MyManager.register('baz', baz, proxytype=GeneratorProxy)

# register get_operator_module(); make public functions accessible via proxy
MyManager.register('operator', get_operator_module)

##

def test():
    manager = MyManager()
    manager.start()

    print('-' * 20)

    f1 = manager.Foo1()
    f1.f()

    print('-' * 20)

    it = manager.baz()

An example showing how to use queues to feed tasks to a collection of worker
processes and collect the results:

```
import time
import random

from multiprocessing import Process, Queue, current_process, freeze_support

#
# Function run by worker processes
#

def worker(input, output):
    for func, args in iter(input.get, 'STOP'):
        result = calculate(func, args)
        output.put(result)

#
# Function used to calculate result
#

def calculate(func, args):
    result = func(*args)
    return '%s says that %s%s = %s' % \
        (current_process().name, func.__name__, args, result)

#
# Functions referenced by tasks
#

def mul(a, b):
    time.sleep(0.5*random.random())
    return a * b

def plus(a, b):
    time.sleep(0.5*random.random())
    return a + b

#
#
#

def test():
    NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES = 4
    TASKS1 = [(mul, (i, 7)) for i in range(20)]
    TASKS2 = [(plus, (i, 8)) for i in range(10)]

    # Create queues
    task_queue = Queue()
    done_queue = Queue()

    # Submit tasks
    for task in TASKS1:
        task_queue.put(task)

    # Start worker processes
    for i in range(NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES):
        Process(target=worker, args=(task_queue, done_queue)).start()

    # Get and print results
    print('Unordered results:')
    for i in range(len(TASKS1)):
        print('\t', done_queue.get())

    # Add more tasks using `put()`
    for task in TASKS2:
        task_queue.put(task)

    # Get and print some more results
    for i in range(len(TASKS2)):
        print('\t', done_queue.get())

    # Tell child processes to stop
    for i in range(NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES):
        task_queue.put('STOP')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    freeze_support()
    test()
```
