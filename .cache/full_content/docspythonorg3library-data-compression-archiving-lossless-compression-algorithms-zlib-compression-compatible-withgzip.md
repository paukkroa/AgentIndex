# `zlib` — Compression compatible with **gzip**[¶](#module-zlib "Link to this heading")

---

For applications that require data compression, the functions in this module
allow compression and decompression, using the [zlib library](https://www.zlib.net).

This is an [optional module](../glossary.html#term-optional-module).
If it is missing from your copy of CPython,
look for documentation from your distributor (that is,
whoever provided Python to you).
If you are the distributor, see [Requirements for optional modules](../using/configure.html#optional-module-requirements).

zlib’s functions have many options and often need to be used in a particular
order. This documentation doesn’t attempt to cover all of the permutations;
consult the [zlib manual](https://www.zlib.net/manual.html) for authoritative
information.

For reading and writing `.gz` files see the [`gzip`](gzip.html#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.") module.

The available exception and functions in this module are:

*exception* zlib.error[¶](#zlib.error "Link to this definition")
:   Exception raised on compression and decompression errors.

zlib.adler32(*data*[, *value*])[¶](#zlib.adler32 "Link to this definition")
:   Computes an Adler-32 checksum of *data*. (An Adler-32 checksum is almost as
    reliable as a CRC32 but can be computed much more quickly.) The result
    is an unsigned 32-bit integer. If *value* is present, it is used as
    the starting value of the checksum; otherwise, a default value of 1
    is used. Passing in *value* allows computing a running checksum over the
    concatenation of several inputs. The algorithm is not cryptographically
    strong, and should not be used for authentication or digital signatures. Since
    the algorithm is designed for use as a checksum algorithm, it is not suitable
    for use as a general hash algorithm.

    Changed in version 3.0: The result is always unsigned.

zlib.compress(*data*, */*, *level=Z\_DEFAULT\_COMPRESSION*, *wbits=MAX\_WBITS*)[¶](#zlib.compress "Link to this definition")
:   Compresses the bytes in *data*, returning a bytes object containing compressed data.
    *level* is an integer from `0` to `9` or `-1` controlling the level of compression;
    See [`Z_BEST_SPEED`](#zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED "zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED") (`1`), [`Z_BEST_COMPRESSION`](#zlib.Z_BEST_COMPRESSION "zlib.Z_BEST_COMPRESSION") (`9`),
    [`Z_NO_COMPRESSION`](#zlib.Z_NO_COMPRESSION "zlib.Z_NO_COMPRESSION") (`0`), and the default,
    [`Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION`](#zlib.Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION "zlib.Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION") (`-1`) for more information about these values.

    The *wbits* argument controls the size of the history buffer (or the
    “window size”) used when compressing data, and whether a header and
    trailer is included in the output. It can take several ranges of values,
    defaulting to `15` ([`MAX_WBITS`](#zlib.MAX_WBITS "zlib.MAX_WBITS")):

    * +9 to +15: The base-two logarithm of the window size, which
      therefore ranges between 512 and 32768. Larger values produce
      better compression at the expense of greater memory usage. The
      resulting output will include a zlib-specific header and trailer.
    * −9 to −15: Uses the absolute value of *wbits* as the
      window size logarithm, while producing a raw output stream with no
      header or trailing checksum.
    * +25 to +31 = 16 + (9 to 15): Uses the low 4 bits of the value as the
      window size logarithm, while including a basic **gzip** header
      and trailing checksum in the output.

    Raises the [`error`](#zlib.error "zlib.error") exception if any error occurs.

    Changed in version 3.6: *level* can now be used as a keyword parameter.

    Changed in version 3.11: The *wbits* parameter is now available to set window bits and
    compression type.

zlib.compressobj(*level=Z\_DEFAULT\_COMPRESSION*, *method=DEFLATED*, *wbits=MAX\_WBITS*, *memLevel=DEF\_MEM\_LEVEL*, *strategy=Z\_DEFAULT\_STRATEGY*[, *zdict*])[¶](#zlib.compressobj "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a compression object, to be used for compressing data streams that won’t
    fit into memory at once.

    *level* is the compression level – an integer from `0` to `9` or `-1`.
    See [`Z_BEST_SPEED`](#zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED "zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED") (`1`), [`Z_BEST_COMPRESSION`](#zlib.Z_BEST_COMPRESSION "zlib.Z_BEST_COMPRESSION") (`9`),
    [`Z_NO_COMPRESSION`](#zlib.Z_NO_COMPRESSION "zlib.Z_NO_COMPRESSION") (`0`), and the default,
    [`Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION`](#zlib.Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION "zlib.Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION") (`-1`) for more information about these values.

    *method* is the compression algorithm. Currently, the only supported value is
    [`DEFLATED`](#zlib.DEFLATED "zlib.DEFLATED").

    The *wbits* parameter controls the size of the history buffer (or the
    “window size”), and what header and trailer format will be used. It has
    the same meaning as [described for compress()](#compress-wbits).

    The *memLevel* argument controls the amount of memory used for the
    internal compression state. Valid values range from `1` to `9`.
    Higher values use more memory, but are faster and produce smaller output.

    *strategy* is used to tune the compression algorithm. Possible values are
    [`Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY`](#zlib.Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY "zlib.Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY"), [`Z_FILTERED`](#zlib.Z_FILTERED "zlib.Z_FILTERED"), [`Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY`](#zlib.Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY "zlib.Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY"),
    [`Z_RLE`](#zlib.Z_RLE "zlib.Z_RLE") and [`Z_FIXED`](#zlib.Z_FIXED "zlib.Z_FIXED").

    *zdict* is a predefined compression dictionary. This is a sequence of bytes
    (such as a [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object) containing subsequences that are expected
    to occur frequently in the data that is to be compressed. Those subsequences
    that are expected to be most common should come at the end of the dictionary.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the *zdict* parameter and keyword argument support.

zlib.crc32(*data*[, *value*])[¶](#zlib.crc32 "Link to this definition")
:   Computes a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checksum of *data*. The
    result is an unsigned 32-bit integer. If *value* is present, it is used
    as the starting value of the checksum; otherwise, a default value of 0
    is used. Passing in *value* allows computing a running checksum over the
    concatenation of several inputs. The algorithm is not cryptographically
    strong, and should not be used for authentication or digital signatures. Since
    the algorithm is designed for use as a checksum algorithm, it is not suitable
    for use as a general hash algorithm.

    Changed in version 3.0: The result is always unsigned.

zlib.decompress(*data*, */*, *wbits=MAX\_WBITS*, *bufsize=DEF\_BUF\_SIZE*)[¶](#zlib.decompress "Link to this definition")
:   Decompresses the bytes in *data*, returning a bytes object containing the
    uncompressed data. The *wbits* parameter depends on
    the format of *data*, and is discussed further below.
    If *bufsize* is given, it is used as the initial size of the output
    buffer. Raises the [`error`](#zlib.error "zlib.error") exception if any error occurs.

    The *wbits* parameter controls the size of the history buffer
    (or “window size”), and what header and trailer format is expected.
    It is similar to the parameter for [`compressobj()`](#zlib.compressobj "zlib.compressobj"), but accepts
    more ranges of values:

    * +8 to +15: The base-two logarithm of the window size. The input
      must include a zlib header and trailer.
    * 0: Automatically determine the window size from the zlib header.
      Only supported since zlib 1.2.3.5.
    * −8 to −15: Uses the absolute value of *wbits* as the window size
      logarithm. The input must be a raw stream with no header or trailer.
    * +24 to +31 = 16 + (8 to 15): Uses the low 4 bits of the value as
      the window size logarithm. The input must include a gzip header and
      trailer.
    * +40 to +47 = 32 + (8 to 15): Uses the low 4 bits of the value as
      the window size logarithm, and automatically accepts either
      the zlib or gzip format.

    When decompressing a stream, the window size must not be smaller
    than the size originally used to compress the stream; using a too-small
    value may result in an [`error`](#zlib.error "zlib.error") exception. The default *wbits* value
    corresponds to the largest window size and requires a zlib header and
    trailer to be included.

    *bufsize* is the initial size of the buffer used to hold decompressed data. If
    more space is required, the buffer size will be increased as needed, so you
    don’t have to get this value exactly right; tuning it will only save a few calls
    to `malloc()`.

    Changed in version 3.6: *wbits* and *bufsize* can be used as keyword arguments.

zlib.decompressobj(*wbits=MAX\_WBITS*[, *zdict*])[¶](#zlib.decompressobj "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a decompression object, to be used for decompressing data streams that
    won’t fit into memory at once.

    The *wbits* parameter controls the size of the history buffer (or the
    “window size”), and what header and trailer format is expected. It has
    the same meaning as [described for decompress()](#decompress-wbits).

    The *zdict* parameter specifies a predefined compression dictionary. If
    provided, this must be the same dictionary as was used by the compressor that
    produced the data that is to be decompressed.

    Note

    If *zdict* is a mutable object (such as a [`bytearray`](stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray")), you must not
    modify its contents between the call to [`decompressobj()`](#zlib.decompressobj "zlib.decompressobj") and the first
    call to the decompressor’s `decompress()` method.

    Changed in version 3.3: Added the *zdict* parameter.

Compression objects support the following methods:

Compress.compress(*data*)[¶](#zlib.Compress.compress "Link to this definition")
:   Compress *data*, returning a bytes object containing compressed data for at least
    part of the data in *data*. This data should be concatenated to the output
    produced by any preceding calls to the [`compress()`](#zlib.compress "zlib.compress") method. Some input may
    be kept in internal buffers for later processing.

Compress.flush([*mode*])[¶](#zlib.Compress.flush "Link to this definition")
:   All pending input is processed, and a bytes object containing the remaining compressed
    output is returned. *mode* can be selected from the constants
    [`Z_NO_FLUSH`](#zlib.Z_NO_FLUSH "zlib.Z_NO_FLUSH"), [`Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH`](#zlib.Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH "zlib.Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH"), [`Z_SYNC_FLUSH`](#zlib.Z_SYNC_FLUSH "zlib.Z_SYNC_FLUSH"),
    [`Z_FULL_FLUSH`](#zlib.Z_FULL_FLUSH "zlib.Z_FULL_FLUSH"), [`Z_BLOCK`](#zlib.Z_BLOCK "zlib.Z_BLOCK"), or [`Z_FINISH`](#zlib.Z_FINISH "zlib.Z_FINISH"),
    defaulting to [`Z_FINISH`](#zlib.Z_FINISH "zlib.Z_FINISH"). Except [`Z_FINISH`](#zlib.Z_FINISH "zlib.Z_FINISH"), all constants
    allow compressing further bytestrings of data, while [`Z_FINISH`](#zlib.Z_FINISH "zlib.Z_FINISH") finishes the
    compressed stream and prevents compressing any more data. After calling [`flush()`](#zlib.Compress.flush "zlib.Compress.flush")
    with *mode* set to [`Z_FINISH`](#zlib.Z_FINISH "zlib.Z_FINISH"), the [`compress()`](#zlib.compress "zlib.compress") method cannot be called again;
    the only realistic action is to delete the object.

Compress.copy()[¶](#zlib.Compress.copy "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a copy of the compression object. This can be used to efficiently
    compress a set of data that share a common initial prefix.

Changed in version 3.8: Added [`copy.copy()`](copy.html#copy.copy "copy.copy") and [`copy.deepcopy()`](copy.html#copy.deepcopy "copy.deepcopy") support to compression
objects.

Decompression objects support the following methods and attributes:

Decompress.unused\_data[¶](#zlib.Decompress.unused_data "Link to this definition")
:   A bytes object which contains any bytes past the end of the compressed data. That is,
    this remains `b""` until the last byte that contains compression data is
    available. If the whole bytestring turned out to contain compressed data, this is
    `b""`, an empty bytes object.

Decompress.unconsumed\_tail[¶](#zlib.Decompress.unconsumed_tail "Link to this definition")
:   A bytes object that contains any data that was not consumed by the last
    [`decompress()`](#zlib.decompress "zlib.decompress") call because it exceeded the limit for the uncompressed data
    buffer. This data has not yet been seen by the zlib machinery, so you must feed
    it (possibly with further data concatenated to it) back to a subsequent
    [`decompress()`](#zlib.decompress "zlib.decompress") method call in order to get correct output.

Decompress.eof[¶](#zlib.Decompress.eof "Link to this definition")
:   A boolean indicating whether the end of the compressed data stream has been
    reached.

    This makes it possible to distinguish between a properly formed compressed
    stream, and an incomplete or truncated one.

    Added in version 3.3.

Decompress.decompress(*data*, *max\_length=0*)[¶](#zlib.Decompress.decompress "Link to this definition")
:   Decompress *data*, returning a bytes object containing the uncompressed data
    corresponding to at least part of the data in *string*. This data should be
    concatenated to the output produced by any preceding calls to the
    [`decompress()`](#zlib.decompress "zlib.decompress") method. Some of the input data may be preserved in internal
    buffers for later processing.

    If the optional parameter *max\_length* is non-zero then the return value will be
    no longer than *max\_length*. This may mean that not all of the compressed input
    can be processed; and unconsumed data will be stored in the attribute
    [`unconsumed_tail`](#zlib.Decompress.unconsumed_tail "zlib.Decompress.unconsumed_tail"). This bytestring must be passed to a subsequent call to
    [`decompress()`](#zlib.decompress "zlib.decompress") if decompression is to continue. If *max\_length* is zero
    then the whole input is decompressed, and [`unconsumed_tail`](#zlib.Decompress.unconsumed_tail "zlib.Decompress.unconsumed_tail") is empty.

    Changed in version 3.6: *max\_length* can be used as a keyword argument.

Decompress.flush([*length*])[¶](#zlib.Decompress.flush "Link to this definition")
:   All pending input is processed, and a bytes object containing the remaining
    uncompressed output is returned. After calling [`flush()`](#zlib.Decompress.flush "zlib.Decompress.flush"), the
    [`decompress()`](#zlib.decompress "zlib.decompress") method cannot be called again; the only realistic action is
    to delete the object.

    The optional parameter *length* sets the initial size of the output buffer.

Decompress.copy()[¶](#zlib.Decompress.copy "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a copy of the decompression object. This can be used to save the state
    of the decompressor midway through the data stream in order to speed up random
    seeks into the stream at a future point.

Changed in version 3.8: Added [`copy.copy()`](copy.html#copy.copy "copy.copy") and [`copy.deepcopy()`](copy.html#copy.deepcopy "copy.deepcopy") support to decompression
objects.

The following constants are available to configure compression and decompression
behavior:

zlib.DEFLATED[¶](#zlib.DEFLATED "Link to this definition")
:   The deflate compression method.

zlib.MAX\_WBITS[¶](#zlib.MAX_WBITS "Link to this definition")
:   The maximum window size, expressed as a power of 2.
    For example, if `MAX_WBITS` is `15` it results in a window size
    of `32 KiB`.

zlib.DEF\_MEM\_LEVEL[¶](#zlib.DEF_MEM_LEVEL "Link to this definition")
:   The default memory level for compression objects.

zlib.DEF\_BUF\_SIZE[¶](#zlib.DEF_BUF_SIZE "Link to this definition")
:   The default buffer size for decompression operations.

zlib.Z\_NO\_COMPRESSION[¶](#zlib.Z_NO_COMPRESSION "Link to this definition")
:   Compression level `0`; no compression.

    Added in version 3.6.

zlib.Z\_BEST\_SPEED[¶](#zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED "Link to this definition")
:   Compression level `1`; fastest and produces the least compression.

zlib.Z\_BEST\_COMPRESSION[¶](#zlib.Z_BEST_COMPRESSION "Link to this definition")
:   Compression level `9`; slowest and produces the most compression.

zlib.Z\_DEFAULT\_COMPRESSION[¶](#zlib.Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION "Link to this definition")
:   Default compression level (`-1`); a compromise between speed and
    compression. Currently equivalent to compression level `6`.

zlib.Z\_DEFAULT\_STRATEGY[¶](#zlib.Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY "Link to this definition")
:   Default compression strategy, for normal data.

zlib.Z\_FILTERED[¶](#zlib.Z_FILTERED "Link to this definition")
:   Compression strategy for data produced by a filter (or predictor).

zlib.Z\_HUFFMAN\_ONLY[¶](#zlib.Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY "Link to this definition")
:   Compression strategy that forces Huffman coding only.

zlib.Z\_RLE[¶](#zlib.Z_RLE "Link to this definition")
:   Compression strategy that limits match distances to one (run-length encoding).

    This constant is only available if Python was compiled with zlib
    1.2.0.1 or greater.

    Added in version 3.6.

zlib.Z\_FIXED[¶](#zlib.Z_FIXED "Link to this definition")
:   Compression strategy that prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes.

    This constant is only available if Python was compiled with zlib
    1.2.2.2 or greater.

    Added in version 3.6.

zlib.Z\_NO\_FLUSH[¶](#zlib.Z_NO_FLUSH "Link to this definition")
:   Flush mode `0`. No special flushing behavior.

    Added in version 3.6.

zlib.Z\_PARTIAL\_FLUSH[¶](#zlib.Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH "Link to this definition")
:   Flush mode `1`. Flush as much output as possible.

zlib.Z\_SYNC\_FLUSH[¶](#zlib.Z_SYNC_FLUSH "Link to this definition")
:   Flush mode `2`. All output is flushed and the output is aligned to a byte boundary.

zlib.Z\_FULL\_FLUSH[¶](#zlib.Z_FULL_FLUSH "Link to this definition")
:   Flush mode `3`. All output is flushed and the compression state is reset.

zlib.Z\_FINISH[¶](#zlib.Z_FINISH "Link to this definition")
:   Flush mode `4`. All pending input is processed, no more input is expected.

zlib.Z\_BLOCK[¶](#zlib.Z_BLOCK "Link to this definition")
:   Flush mode `5`. A deflate block is completed and emitted.

    This constant is only available if Python was compiled with zlib
    1.2.2.2 or greater.

    Added in version 3.6.

zlib.Z\_TREES[¶](#zlib.Z_TREES "Link to this definition")
:   Flush mode `6`, for inflate operations. Instructs inflate to return when
    it gets to the next deflate block boundary.

    This constant is only available if Python was compiled with zlib
    1.2.3.4 or greater.

    Added in version 3.6.

Information about the version of the zlib library in use is available through
the following constants:

zlib.ZLIB\_VERSION[¶](#zlib.ZLIB_VERSION "Link to this definition")
:   The version string of the zlib library that was used for building the module.
    This may be different from the zlib library actually used at runtime, which
    is available as [`ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION`](#zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION "zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION").

zlib.ZLIB\_RUNTIME\_VERSION[¶](#zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION "Link to this definition")
:   The version string of the zlib library actually loaded by the interpreter.

    Added in version 3.3.

zlib.ZLIBNG\_VERSION[¶](#zlib.ZLIBNG_VERSION "Link to this definition")
:   The version string of the zlib-ng library that was used for building the
    module if zlib-ng was used. When present, the [`ZLIB_VERSION`](#zlib.ZLIB_VERSION "zlib.ZLIB_VERSION") and
    [`ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION`](#zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION "zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION") constants reflect the version of the zlib API
    provided by zlib-ng.

    If zlib-ng was not used to build the module, this constant will be absent.

    Added in version 3.14.
