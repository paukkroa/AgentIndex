# `random` — Generate pseudo-random numbers[¶](#module-random "Link to this heading")

**Source code:** [Lib/random.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/random.py)

---

This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various
distributions.

For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there is
uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random
permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without
replacement.

On the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal (Gaussian),
lognormal, negative exponential, gamma, and beta distributions. For generating
distributions of angles, the von Mises distribution is available.

Almost all module functions depend on the basic function [`random()`](#random.random "random.random"), which
generates a random float uniformly in the half-open range `0.0 <= X < 1.0`.
Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator. It produces 53-bit precision
floats and has a period of 2\*\*19937-1. The underlying implementation in C is
both fast and threadsafe. The Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively
tested random number generators in existence. However, being completely
deterministic, it is not suitable for all purposes, and is completely unsuitable
for cryptographic purposes.

The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden
instance of the [`random.Random`](#random.Random "random.Random") class. You can instantiate your own
instances of [`Random`](#random.Random "random.Random") to get generators that don’t share state.

Class [`Random`](#random.Random "random.Random") can also be subclassed if you want to use a different
basic generator of your own devising: see the documentation on that class for
more details.

The `random` module also provides the [`SystemRandom`](#random.SystemRandom "random.SystemRandom") class which
uses the system function [`os.urandom()`](os.html#os.urandom "os.urandom") to generate random numbers
from sources provided by the operating system.

Warning

The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for
security purposes. For security or cryptographic uses, see the
[`secrets`](secrets.html#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.") module.

equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator”, ACM Transactions on

random number generator with a long period and comparatively simple update
operations.

Note

The global random number generator and instances of [`Random`](#random.Random "random.Random") are thread-safe.
However, in the free-threaded build, concurrent calls to the global generator or
to the same instance of [`Random`](#random.Random "random.Random") may encounter contention and poor performance.
Consider using separate instances of [`Random`](#random.Random "random.Random") per thread instead.

## Bookkeeping functions[¶](#bookkeeping-functions "Link to this heading")

random.seed(*a=None*, *version=2*)[¶](#random.seed "Link to this definition")
:   Initialize the random number generator.

    If *a* is omitted or `None`, the current system time is used. If
    randomness sources are provided by the operating system, they are used
    instead of the system time (see the [`os.urandom()`](os.html#os.urandom "os.urandom") function for details
    on availability).

    If *a* is an int, its absolute value is used directly.

    With version 2 (the default), a [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str"), [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"), or [`bytearray`](stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray")
    object gets converted to an [`int`](functions.html#int "int") and all of its bits are used.

    With version 1 (provided for reproducing random sequences from older versions
    of Python), the algorithm for [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str") and [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") generates a
    narrower range of seeds.

    Changed in version 3.2: Moved to the version 2 scheme which uses all of the bits in a string seed.

    Changed in version 3.11: The *seed* must be one of the following types:
    `None`, [`int`](functions.html#int "int"), [`float`](functions.html#float "float"), [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str"),
    [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"), or [`bytearray`](stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray").

random.getstate()[¶](#random.getstate "Link to this definition")
:   Return an object capturing the current internal state of the generator. This
    object can be passed to [`setstate()`](#random.setstate "random.setstate") to restore the state.

random.setstate(*state*)[¶](#random.setstate "Link to this definition")
:   *state* should have been obtained from a previous call to [`getstate()`](#random.getstate "random.getstate"), and
    [`setstate()`](#random.setstate "random.setstate") restores the internal state of the generator to what it was at
    the time [`getstate()`](#random.getstate "random.getstate") was called.

## Functions for bytes[¶](#functions-for-bytes "Link to this heading")

random.randbytes(*n*)[¶](#random.randbytes "Link to this definition")
:   Generate *n* random bytes.

    This method should not be used for generating security tokens.
    Use [`secrets.token_bytes()`](secrets.html#secrets.token_bytes "secrets.token_bytes") instead.

    Added in version 3.9.

## Functions for integers[¶](#functions-for-integers "Link to this heading")

random.randrange(*stop*)[¶](#random.randrange "Link to this definition")

random.randrange(*start*, *stop*[, *step*])
:   Return a randomly selected element from `range(start, stop, step)`.

    This is roughly equivalent to `choice(range(start, stop, step))` but
    supports arbitrarily large ranges and is optimized for common cases.

    The positional argument pattern matches the [`range()`](stdtypes.html#range "range") function.

    Keyword arguments should not be used because they can be interpreted
    in unexpected ways. For example `randrange(start=100)` is interpreted
    as `randrange(0, 100, 1)`.

    Changed in version 3.2: [`randrange()`](#random.randrange "random.randrange") is more sophisticated about producing equally distributed
    values. Formerly it used a style like `int(random()*n)` which could produce
    slightly uneven distributions.

    Changed in version 3.12: Automatic conversion of non-integer types is no longer supported.
    Calls such as `randrange(10.0)` and `randrange(Fraction(10, 1))`
    now raise a [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

random.randint(*a*, *b*)[¶](#random.randint "Link to this definition")
:   Return a random integer *N* such that `a <= N <= b`. Alias for
    `randrange(a, b+1)`.

random.getrandbits(*k*)[¶](#random.getrandbits "Link to this definition")
:   Returns a non-negative Python integer with *k* random bits. This method
    is supplied with the Mersenne Twister generator and some other generators
    may also provide it as an optional part of the API. When available,
    [`getrandbits()`](#random.getrandbits "random.getrandbits") enables [`randrange()`](#random.randrange "random.randrange") to handle arbitrarily large
    ranges.

    Changed in version 3.9: This method now accepts zero for *k*.

## Functions for sequences[¶](#functions-for-sequences "Link to this heading")

random.choice(*seq*)[¶](#random.choice "Link to this definition")
:   Return a random element from the non-empty sequence *seq*. If *seq* is empty,
    raises [`IndexError`](exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError").

random.choices(*population*, *weights=None*, *\**, *cum\_weights=None*, *k=1*)[¶](#random.choices "Link to this definition")
:   Return a *k* sized list of elements chosen from the *population* with replacement.
    If the *population* is empty, raises [`IndexError`](exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError").

    If a *weights* sequence is specified, selections are made according to the
    relative weights. Alternatively, if a *cum\_weights* sequence is given, the
    selections are made according to the cumulative weights (perhaps computed
    using [`itertools.accumulate()`](itertools.html#itertools.accumulate "itertools.accumulate")). For example, the relative weights
    `[10, 5, 30, 5]` are equivalent to the cumulative weights
    `[10, 15, 45, 50]`. Internally, the relative weights are converted to
    cumulative weights before making selections, so supplying the cumulative
    weights saves work.

    If neither *weights* nor *cum\_weights* are specified, selections are made
    with equal probability. If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be
    the same length as the *population* sequence. It is a [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError")
    to specify both *weights* and *cum\_weights*.

    The *weights* or *cum\_weights* can use any numeric type that interoperates
    with the [`float`](functions.html#float "float") values returned by [`random()`](#module-random "random: Generate pseudo-random numbers with various common distributions.") (that includes
    integers, floats, and fractions but excludes decimals). Weights are assumed
    to be non-negative and finite. A [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if all
    weights are zero.

    For a given seed, the [`choices()`](#random.choices "random.choices") function with equal weighting
    typically produces a different sequence than repeated calls to
    [`choice()`](#random.choice "random.choice"). The algorithm used by [`choices()`](#random.choices "random.choices") uses floating-point
    arithmetic for internal consistency and speed. The algorithm used
    by [`choice()`](#random.choice "random.choice") defaults to integer arithmetic with repeated selections
    to avoid small biases from round-off error.

    Added in version 3.6.

    Changed in version 3.9: Raises a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if all weights are zero.

random.shuffle(*x*)[¶](#random.shuffle "Link to this definition")
:   Shuffle the sequence *x* in place.

    To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use
    `sample(x, k=len(x))` instead.

    Note that even for small `len(x)`, the total number of permutations of *x*
    can quickly grow larger than the period of most random number generators.
    This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be
    generated. For example, a sequence of length 2080 is the largest that
    can fit within the period of the Mersenne Twister random number generator.

    Changed in version 3.11: Removed the optional parameter *random*.

random.sample(*population*, *k*, *\**, *counts=None*)[¶](#random.sample "Link to this definition")
:   Return a *k* length list of unique elements chosen from the population
    sequence. Used for random sampling without replacement.

    Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the
    original population unchanged. The resulting list is in selection order so that
    all sub-slices will also be valid random samples. This allows raffle winners
    (the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place winners (the
    subslices).

    Members of the population need not be [hashable](../glossary.html#term-hashable) or unique. If the population
    contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible selection in the sample.

    Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional
    keyword-only *counts* parameter. For example, `sample(['red', 'blue'],
    counts=[4, 2], k=5)` is equivalent to `sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red',
    'blue', 'blue'], k=5)`.

    To choose a sample from a range of integers, use a [`range()`](stdtypes.html#range "range") object as an
    argument. This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a large
    population: `sample(range(10000000), k=60)`.

    If the sample size is larger than the population size, a [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError")
    is raised.

    Changed in version 3.9: Added the *counts* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.11: The *population* must be a sequence. Automatic conversion of sets
    to lists is no longer supported.

## Discrete distributions[¶](#discrete-distributions "Link to this heading")

The following function generates a discrete distribution.

random.binomialvariate(*n=1*, *p=0.5*)[¶](#random.binomialvariate "Link to this definition")
:   [Binomial distribution](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialDistribution.html).
    Return the number of successes for *n* independent trials with the
    probability of success in each trial being *p*:

    Mathematically equivalent to:

    ```
    sum(random() < p for i in range(n))
    ```

    The number of trials *n* should be a non-negative integer.
    The probability of success *p* should be between `0.0 <= p <= 1.0`.
    The result is an integer in the range `0 <= X <= n`.

    Added in version 3.12.

## Real-valued distributions[¶](#real-valued-distributions "Link to this heading")

The following functions generate specific real-valued distributions. Function
parameters are named after the corresponding variables in the distribution’s
equation, as used in common mathematical practice; most of these equations can
be found in any statistics text.

random.random()[¶](#random.random "Link to this definition")
:   Return the next random floating-point number in the range `0.0 <= X < 1.0`

random.uniform(*a*, *b*)[¶](#random.uniform "Link to this definition")
:   Return a random floating-point number *N* such that `a <= N <= b` for
    `a <= b` and `b <= N <= a` for `b < a`.

    The end-point value `b` may or may not be included in the range
    depending on floating-point rounding in the expression
    `a + (b-a) * random()`.

random.triangular(*low*, *high*, *mode*)[¶](#random.triangular "Link to this definition")
:   Return a random floating-point number *N* such that `low <= N <= high` and
    with the specified *mode* between those bounds. The *low* and *high* bounds
    default to zero and one. The *mode* argument defaults to the midpoint
    between the bounds, giving a symmetric distribution.

random.betavariate(*alpha*, *beta*)[¶](#random.betavariate "Link to this definition")
:   Beta distribution. Conditions on the parameters are `alpha > 0` and
    `beta > 0`. Returned values range between 0 and 1.

random.expovariate(*lambd=1.0*)[¶](#random.expovariate "Link to this definition")
:   Exponential distribution. *lambd* is 1.0 divided by the desired
    mean. It should be nonzero. (The parameter would be called
    “lambda”, but that is a reserved word in Python.) Returned values
    range from 0 to positive infinity if *lambd* is positive, and from
    negative infinity to 0 if *lambd* is negative.

    Changed in version 3.12: Added the default value for `lambd`.

random.gammavariate(*alpha*, *beta*)[¶](#random.gammavariate "Link to this definition")
:   Gamma distribution. (*Not* the gamma function!) The shape and
    scale parameters, *alpha* and *beta*, must have positive values.
    (Calling conventions vary and some sources define ‘beta’
    as the inverse of the scale).

    The probability distribution function is:

    ```
              x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
    pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
                math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
    ```

random.gauss(*mu=0.0*, *sigma=1.0*)[¶](#random.gauss "Link to this definition")
:   Normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution.
    *mu* is the mean,
    and *sigma* is the standard deviation. This is slightly faster than
    the [`normalvariate()`](#random.normalvariate "random.normalvariate") function defined below.

    Multithreading note: When two threads call this function
    simultaneously, it is possible that they will receive the
    same return value. This can be avoided in three ways.
    1) Have each thread use a different instance of the random
    number generator. 2) Put locks around all calls. 3) Use the
    slower, but thread-safe [`normalvariate()`](#random.normalvariate "random.normalvariate") function instead.

    Changed in version 3.11: *mu* and *sigma* now have default arguments.

random.lognormvariate(*mu*, *sigma*)[¶](#random.lognormvariate "Link to this definition")
:   Log normal distribution. If you take the natural logarithm of this
    distribution, you’ll get a normal distribution with mean *mu* and standard
    deviation *sigma*. *mu* can have any value, and *sigma* must be greater than
    zero.

random.normalvariate(*mu=0.0*, *sigma=1.0*)[¶](#random.normalvariate "Link to this definition")
:   Normal distribution. *mu* is the mean, and *sigma* is the standard deviation.

    Changed in version 3.11: *mu* and *sigma* now have default arguments.

random.vonmisesvariate(*mu*, *kappa*)[¶](#random.vonmisesvariate "Link to this definition")
:   *mu* is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2\**pi*, and *kappa*
    is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or equal to zero. If
    *kappa* is equal to zero, this distribution reduces to a uniform random angle
    over the range 0 to 2\**pi*.

random.paretovariate(*alpha*)[¶](#random.paretovariate "Link to this definition")
:   Pareto distribution. *alpha* is the shape parameter.

random.weibullvariate(*alpha*, *beta*)[¶](#random.weibullvariate "Link to this definition")
:   Weibull distribution. *alpha* is the scale parameter and *beta* is the shape
    parameter.

## Alternative Generator[¶](#alternative-generator "Link to this heading")

*class* random.Random([*seed*])[¶](#random.Random "Link to this definition")
:   Class that implements the default pseudo-random number generator used by the
    `random` module.

    Changed in version 3.11: Formerly the *seed* could be any hashable object. Now it is limited to:
    `None`, [`int`](functions.html#int "int"), [`float`](functions.html#float "float"), [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str"),
    [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes"), or [`bytearray`](stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray").

    Subclasses of `Random` should override the following methods if they
    wish to make use of a different basic generator:

    seed(*a=None*, *version=2*)[¶](#random.Random.seed "Link to this definition")
    :   Override this method in subclasses to customise the [`seed()`](#random.seed "random.seed")
        behaviour of `Random` instances.

    getstate()[¶](#random.Random.getstate "Link to this definition")
    :   Override this method in subclasses to customise the [`getstate()`](#random.getstate "random.getstate")
        behaviour of `Random` instances.

    setstate(*state*)[¶](#random.Random.setstate "Link to this definition")
    :   Override this method in subclasses to customise the [`setstate()`](#random.setstate "random.setstate")
        behaviour of `Random` instances.

    random()[¶](#random.Random.random "Link to this definition")
    :   Override this method in subclasses to customise the [`random()`](#random.random "random.random")
        behaviour of `Random` instances.

    Optionally, a custom generator subclass can also supply the following method:

    getrandbits(*k*)[¶](#random.Random.getrandbits "Link to this definition")
    :   Override this method in subclasses to customise the
        [`getrandbits()`](#random.getrandbits "random.getrandbits") behaviour of `Random` instances.

    randbytes(*n*)[¶](#random.Random.randbytes "Link to this definition")
    :   Override this method in subclasses to customise the
        [`randbytes()`](#random.randbytes "random.randbytes") behaviour of `Random` instances.

*class* random.SystemRandom([*seed*])[¶](#random.SystemRandom "Link to this definition")
:   Class that uses the [`os.urandom()`](os.html#os.urandom "os.urandom") function for generating random numbers
    from sources provided by the operating system. Not available on all systems.
    Does not rely on software state, and sequences are not reproducible. Accordingly,
    the [`seed()`](#random.seed "random.seed") method has no effect and is ignored.
    The [`getstate()`](#random.getstate "random.getstate") and [`setstate()`](#random.setstate "random.setstate") methods raise
    [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError") if called.

## Notes on Reproducibility[¶](#notes-on-reproducibility "Link to this heading")

Sometimes it is useful to be able to reproduce the sequences given by a
pseudo-random number generator. By reusing a seed value, the same sequence should be
reproducible from run to run as long as multiple threads are not running.

Most of the random module’s algorithms and seeding functions are subject to
change across Python versions, but two aspects are guaranteed not to change:

* If a new seeding method is added, then a backward compatible seeder will be
  offered.
* The generator’s [`random()`](#random.Random.random "random.Random.random") method will continue to produce the same
  sequence when the compatible seeder is given the same seed.

## Examples[¶](#examples "Link to this heading")

Basic examples:

```
>>> random()                          # Random float:  0.0 <= x < 1.0
0.37444887175646646

>>> uniform(2.5, 10.0)                # Random float:  2.5 <= x <= 10.0
3.1800146073117523

>>> expovariate(1 / 5)                # Interval between arrivals averaging 5 seconds
5.148957571865031

>>> randrange(10)                     # Integer from 0 to 9 inclusive

>>> randrange(0, 101, 2)              # Even integer from 0 to 100 inclusive
26

>>> choice(['win', 'lose', 'draw'])   # Single random element from a sequence
'draw'

>>> deck = 'ace two three four'.split()
>>> shuffle(deck)                     # Shuffle a list
>>> deck
['four', 'two', 'ace', 'three']

>>> sample([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], k=4) # Four samples without replacement
[40, 10, 50, 30]
```

Simulations:

```
>>> # Six roulette wheel spins (weighted sampling with replacement)
>>> choices(['red', 'black', 'green'], [18, 18, 2], k=6)
['red', 'green', 'black', 'black', 'red', 'black']

>>> # Deal 20 cards without replacement from a deck
>>> # of 52 playing cards, and determine the proportion of cards
>>> # with a ten-value:  ten, jack, queen, or king.
>>> deal = sample(['tens', 'low cards'], counts=[16, 36], k=20)
>>> deal.count('tens') / 20
0.15

>>> # Estimate the probability of getting 5 or more heads from 7 spins
>>> # of a biased coin that settles on heads 60% of the time.
>>> sum(binomialvariate(n=7, p=0.6) >= 5 for i in range(10_000)) / 10_000
0.4169

>>> # Probability of the median of 5 samples being in middle two quartiles
>>> def trial():
...     return 2_500 <= sorted(choices(range(10_000), k=5))[2] < 7_500
...
>>> sum(trial() for i in range(10_000)) / 10_000
0.7958
```

Example of [statistical bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) using resampling
with replacement to estimate a confidence interval for the mean of a sample:

```
# https://www.thoughtco.com/example-of-bootstrapping-3126155
from statistics import fmean as mean
from random import choices

data = [41, 50, 29, 37, 81, 30, 73, 63, 20, 35, 68, 22, 60, 31, 95]
means = sorted(mean(choices(data, k=len(data))) for i in range(100))
print(f'The sample mean of {mean(data):.1f} has a 90% confidence '
      f'interval from {means[5]:.1f} to {means[94]:.1f}')
```

Example of a [resampling permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)#Permutation_tests)
to determine the statistical significance or [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) of an observed difference
between the effects of a drug versus a placebo:

```
# Example from "Statistics is Easy" by Dennis Shasha and Manda Wilson
from statistics import fmean as mean
from random import shuffle

drug = [54, 73, 53, 70, 73, 68, 52, 65, 65]
placebo = [54, 51, 58, 44, 55, 52, 42, 47, 58, 46]
observed_diff = mean(drug) - mean(placebo)

n = 10_000
count = 0
combined = drug + placebo
for i in range(n):
    shuffle(combined)
    new_diff = mean(combined[:len(drug)]) - mean(combined[len(drug):])
    count += (new_diff >= observed_diff)

print(f'{n} label reshufflings produced only {count} instances with a difference')
print(f'at least as extreme as the observed difference of {observed_diff:.1f}.')
print(f'The one-sided p-value of {count / n:.4f} leads us to reject the null')
print(f'hypothesis that there is no difference between the drug and the placebo.')
```

Simulation of arrival times and service deliveries for a multiserver queue:

```
from heapq import heapify, heapreplace
from random import expovariate, gauss
from statistics import mean, quantiles

average_arrival_interval = 5.6
average_service_time = 15.0
stdev_service_time = 3.5
num_servers = 3

waits = []
arrival_time = 0.0
servers = [0.0] * num_servers  # time when each server becomes available
heapify(servers)
for i in range(1_000_000):
    arrival_time += expovariate(1.0 / average_arrival_interval)
    next_server_available = servers[0]
    wait = max(0.0, next_server_available - arrival_time)
    waits.append(wait)
    service_duration = max(0.0, gauss(average_service_time, stdev_service_time))
    service_completed = arrival_time + wait + service_duration
    heapreplace(servers, service_completed)

print(f'Mean wait: {mean(waits):.1f}   Max wait: {max(waits):.1f}')
print('Quartiles:', [round(q, 1) for q in quantiles(waits)])
```

## Recipes[¶](#recipes "Link to this heading")

These recipes show how to efficiently make random selections
from the combinatoric iterators in the [`itertools`](itertools.html#module-itertools "itertools: Functions creating iterators for efficient looping.") module:

```
import random

def random_product(*iterables, repeat=1):
    "Random selection from itertools.product(*iterables, repeat=repeat)"
    pools = tuple(map(tuple, iterables)) * repeat
    return tuple(map(random.choice, pools))

def random_permutation(iterable, r=None):
    "Random selection from itertools.permutations(iterable, r)"
    pool = tuple(iterable)
    r = len(pool) if r is None else r
    return tuple(random.sample(pool, r))

def random_combination(iterable, r):
    "Random selection from itertools.combinations(iterable, r)"
    pool = tuple(iterable)
    n = len(pool)
    indices = sorted(random.sample(range(n), r))
    return tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)

def random_combination_with_replacement(iterable, r):
    "Choose r elements with replacement.  Order the result to match the iterable."
    # Result will be in set(itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r)).
    pool = tuple(iterable)
    n = len(pool)
    indices = sorted(random.choices(range(n), k=r))
    return tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)

def random_derangement(iterable):
    "Choose a permutation where no element stays in its original position."
    seq = tuple(iterable)
    if len(seq) < 2:
        if not seq:
            return ()
        raise IndexError('No derangments to choose from')
    perm = list(range(len(seq)))
    start = tuple(perm)
    while True:
        random.shuffle(perm)
        if all(p != q for p, q in zip(start, perm)):
            return tuple([seq[i] for i in perm])
```

The default [`random()`](#random.random "random.random") returns multiples of 2⁻⁵³ in the range
*0.0 ≤ x < 1.0*. All such numbers are evenly spaced and are exactly
representable as Python floats. However, many other representable
floats in that interval are not possible selections. For example,
`0.05954861408025609` isn’t an integer multiple of 2⁻⁵³.

The following recipe takes a different approach. All floats in the
interval are possible selections. The mantissa comes from a uniform
distribution of integers in the range *2⁵² ≤ mantissa < 2⁵³*. The
exponent comes from a geometric distribution where exponents smaller
than *-53* occur half as often as the next larger exponent.

```
from random import Random
from math import ldexp

class FullRandom(Random):

    def random(self):
        mantissa = 0x10_0000_0000_0000 | self.getrandbits(52)
        exponent = -53
        x = 0
        while not x:
            x = self.getrandbits(32)
            exponent += x.bit_length() - 32
        return ldexp(mantissa, exponent)
```

All [real valued distributions](#real-valued-distributions)
in the class will use the new method:

```
>>> fr = FullRandom()
>>> fr.random()
0.05954861408025609
>>> fr.expovariate(0.25)
8.87925541791544
```

The recipe is conceptually equivalent to an algorithm that chooses from
all the multiples of 2⁻¹⁰⁷⁴ in the range *0.0 ≤ x < 1.0*. All such
numbers are evenly spaced, but most have to be rounded down to the
nearest representable Python float. (The value 2⁻¹⁰⁷⁴ is the smallest
positive unnormalized float and is equal to `math.ulp(0.0)`.)

[Generating Pseudo-random Floating-Point Values](https://allendowney.com/research/rand/downey07randfloat.pdf) a
paper by Allen B. Downey describing ways to generate more
fine-grained floats than normally generated by [`random()`](#random.random "random.random").

## Command-line usage[¶](#command-line-usage "Link to this heading")

Added in version 3.13.

The `random` module can be executed from the command line.

```
python -m random [-h] [-c CHOICE [CHOICE ...] | -i N | -f N] [input ...]
```

The following options are accepted:

-h, --help[¶](#cmdoption-random-h "Link to this definition")
:   Show the help message and exit.

-c CHOICE [CHOICE ...][¶](#cmdoption-random-c "Link to this definition")

--choice CHOICE [CHOICE ...][¶](#cmdoption-random-choice "Link to this definition")
:   Print a random choice, using [`choice()`](#random.choice "random.choice").

-i <N>[¶](#cmdoption-random-i "Link to this definition")

--integer <N>[¶](#cmdoption-random-integer "Link to this definition")
:   Print a random integer between 1 and N inclusive, using [`randint()`](#random.randint "random.randint").

-f <N>[¶](#cmdoption-random-f "Link to this definition")

--float <N>[¶](#cmdoption-random-float "Link to this definition")
:   Print a random floating-point number between 0 and N inclusive,
    using [`uniform()`](#random.uniform "random.uniform").

If no options are given, the output depends on the input:

* String or multiple: same as [`--choice`](#cmdoption-random-choice).
* Integer: same as [`--integer`](#cmdoption-random-integer).
* Float: same as [`--float`](#cmdoption-random-float).

## Command-line example[¶](#command-line-example "Link to this heading")

Here are some examples of the `random` command-line interface:

```
$ # Choose one at random
$ python -m random egg bacon sausage spam "Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce"
Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce

$ # Random integer
$ python -m random 6
6

$ # Random floating-point number
$ python -m random 1.8
1.7080016272295635

$ # With explicit arguments
$ python  -m random --choice egg bacon sausage spam "Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce"
egg

$ python -m random --integer 6
3

$ python -m random --float 1.8
1.5666339105010318

$ python -m random --integer 6
